      class="h2fs"><i>Foreword</i></span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The panorama of sea, island, and mountain, which holds Sitka, Alaska, as a
      jewel in its setting, is one of the most beautiful of those which surround
      the cities of the world. Toward the sea from the peninsula on which Sitka
      is situated stretches an expanse of waters, studded with forest-clad
      islands which break the swell of the Pacific that foams and tumbles on the
      outer barriers. To the westward Mount Edgecumbe lifts its perfect cone,
      its summit truncated by the old crater whose fires have been dead for
      centuries; to the northward Harbor peak lifts its signal to mariners; the
      Sisters, with a gleam of snow and ice among their pinnacles, lie in the
      distance of Indian River; to the east is the arrowhead of Mount Verstovia;
      the glaciers glisten beyond; and the sweep of mist-clad mountains, in
      their softness, beyond the bay to the southeast completes the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radiating like the spokes of a wheel, waterways with historic memories
      reach out <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_2"></a>2</span> from
      the town. Krestof Bay, where the early navigators cast anchor; Neva
      Strait, commemorating the first Russian ship that visited Sitka from
      around the world; Katleanski Bay, on which was situated Old Sitka; Silver
      Bay, a Norwegian fjord transplanted to Alaska; Lisianski Bay, named for
      the Russian navigator of a century ago; the inlet at Ozerskoe Redoubt and
      Globokoe (Deep) Lake; the island-studded way to the Hot Springs; each with
      its individual charm; the ocean, with the deep, rich, marine tints of
      northern waters; the forest of blue, that folds like a robe over the
      mountains; the mountain summits beside the glaciers, clad in the
      exquisitely wonderful green of the Northland, all are delightful. But when
      the sun sinks low in the west, with the long, lingering twilight of the
      North, and the soft, delicate rays touch and blend with the water and
      islands, the mountains and sky&#8211;then, in the mystery of the evening,
      is the supreme beauty of the land. To those who have really known and
      loved Sitka, there is no place on earth to compare.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are pleasant recollections of those who have lived there. Jovial
      Edward Degroff and his stories at the Roastology Club; the Mills, whose
      hospitable home is known to every resident of the town; Wm. Gouverneur
      Morris, whose name recalls a leader of <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_3"></a>3</span> Revolutionary days; genial George Barron, who
      upheld every good tradition of the Navy; the gallant old soldier, Matthew
      P. Berry; dignified Judge Delaney, Alaska&#8217;s staunchest advocate
      through all vicissitudes; Governor Brady, with his neverfailing faith in
      Alaska&#8217;s greatness; Captain Francis, without whom the early naval
      commanders thought the warships could not thread the intricate passages;
      Nicholas Haley, with his optimistic dreams of El Doradoes; Pauline
      Archangelsky, for whom the &#8220;Old Timers&#8221; have pleasant
      recollections; Alonzo Austin and his mission; Captain Kilgore of the
      &#8220;Rush&#8221;; Merrill, who caught on the photograph plate the
      elusive spirit of the varying surroundings as only a true artist could;
      Katherine Delaney Abrams, whose touch in watercolor delineated the glory
      of the sunsets as none else could; Professor Richardson, who for a quarter
      of a century returned year after year thousands of miles to perpetuate in
      paintings the exquisite tintings of glaciers and mountain; George
      Kostromitinoff (Father Sergius); Father Metropolski, and many others who
      have made a part of the quaint old town.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a saying that whosoever comes to love the waters of the Indian
      River will ever after yearn for them, and it seems true, <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_4"></a>4</span> for always is that
      harking back to its banks with an unsatisfied longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      From prehistoric time this has been the home of the Sitka Kwan of the
      Thlingit people. For sixty-three years it was the scene of the chief
      activities of the Russian American Company, who represented the rule of
      the Muscovites, who, when Chicago was but a blockhouse in a sedgy swamp on
      the banks of a sluggish, reedy river, and when San Francisco was but a
      mission and a Presidio of sun-burned bricks, maintained in Sitka a
      community of busy people who were casting cannon and bells, and who were
      building ships for commerce.

      In the establishment of this outpost the foundation was laid for the title
      of the United States to the southeastern part of Alaska, a land rich in
      fur and forest, in gold and copper, in marble and fish, the potential
      possibilities of which are not even approximately forecasted today. Enough
      to say of it, that in its limits are two mines, one of which has yielded
      over sixty-five millions of dollars in gold, and the other ranks among the
      richest of the mineral producing veins of the world.

      Some may have an interest in the story of the quaint, quiet, beautiful
      village on the shore of Baranof Island. I hope this may add something to
      history, keeping the events of the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_5"></a>5</span> past bright in the memory of those who love the
      Northland and its story, and add a little of interest and information of
      the present to those who come as transient visitors to while away a few
      days among the myriad islands of the Sitkan Archipelago. It is a link to
      connect the Sitka of the past, the <i>Novo Arkangelsk</i> of the great
      Russian American Company in the romantic days of the fur trade when it was
      the center of the vast domain of Russian America and gathered to its
      magazines the pelts of sea-otter and fox, with the Sitka of today with its
      fisheries and mines. The old landmarks are fast disappearing, scarce a
      year passes without some monument passing away, and even their location
      will soon be forgotten unless some record is made for those who do not
      know where they stood.

      Sitka of the Russians, a century ago, was the center of trade and
      civilization on the Northwest Coast of America, the chief factory of the
      Russian American Company in the vast and little known land of the Russian
      Possessions in America. The sails of ships from far off Kronstadt on the
      Baltic brought Russian cargoes. The famous clipper ships of New England
      made it a stopping place on their way to the China seas. English traders
      and explorers visited it on their voyages, and in it was centered the
      trade of a wide region. It was the chief factory of the greatest rival in
      the fur trade of the world, with which the Honourable, <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_8"></a>8</span> the Hudson&#8217;s Bay
      Company, which then was the controlling power in the English fur market,
      had to contend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Sitka goes back past the middle of the Eighteenth Century.
      There are Russians, Spanish, English, French and Americans who have woven
      each their own part of the web of the tale, and the scenes have been as
      varied and strange as the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 16, 1741, a Russian ship stood into a broad harbor on the Northwest
      Coast of America. The commander, Captain Alexei Chirikof, had sailed three
      thousand miles across the unknown Pacific from the shores of the Okhotsk
      Sea. Civilized eyes had never before rested on these shores and he was
      keen with the excitement of adventure and discovery as he dropped anchor.
      He sent a party ashore in the ship&#8217;s longboat to explore, and
      awaited the result. Days passed and no word or signal came, so the
      remaining boat was sent to recall the party and it was swallowed up in the
      labyrinth among the green islands. Signals indicated that it safely landed
      but none returned to the ship although the orders were imperative that
      both boats return at once. The last boat was gone. Three weeks passed.
      Captain Chirikof could not reach the shore and could no longer lie at
      anchor, so reluctantly and sadly he set his course for the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_9"></a>9</span> far off Kamchatkan
      shores and sailed away from the port of missing men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly two centuries have passed since the Russian seamen landed and no
      word has come from them. For more than seventy years the Russian
      Government sought for some sign of their fate.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Tales were told of
      a colony of Russians existing on the coast but each upon investigation
      proved but a rumor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a dim tradition among the Sitkas of men being lured ashore in the
      long ago. They say that Chief Annahootz, the predecessor of the chief of
      that name who was the firm friend of the whites at Sitka in 1878, was the
      leading actor in the tragedy. Annahootz dressed himself in the skin of a
      bear and played along the beach. So skillfully did he simulate the sinuous
      motions of the animal that the Russians in the excitement of the chase
      plunged into the woods in pursuit and there the savage warriors killed
      them to a man, leaving none to tell the story. The disappearance of
      Chirikof&#8217;s men has remained one of the many unsolved mysteries of
      the Northland, and their fate will never be known to a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_10"></a>10</span>The faulty
      record of the navigation of a time that counted by dead reckoning, and
      without a knowledge of the currents of those seas, does not tell us the
      exact location of the anchorage, but beyond a reasonable doubt it was in
      Sitka Sound, and the Russian seamen died at the hands of the Sitka Kwan of
      the Thlingits. In this manner Sitka first became known to the White Man&#8217;s
      World.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th day of August, 1775, came the Royal Standard of Spain, flung
      to the breeze from the little schooner &#8220;Sonora,&#8221; only 36 feet
      in length, under command of Don Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. Quadra
      was one of the greatest and best of the Spanish navigators in the North.
      His voyages are among the most successful of those of the mariners of his
      nation in the waters of the north Pacific ocean, and his name was once
      linked with that of the English Commander on the island now bearing the
      name of Vancouver. Quadra came from the Mexican port of San Blas, and
      after many thrilling adventures and grievous hardships he sailed into a
      broad bay and dropped anchor. There was a mountain, of which he says:
      &#8220;Of the most regular and beautiful form I had ever seen. It was also
      quite detached from the great ridge of mountains. Its top was covered with
      snow, under which appeared some gullies, which continue till about the
      middle of the mountain, and from thence to the bottom are trees of the
      same kind as those at Trinity.&#8221;

      mountain <i>San Jacinthus</i>, and the point of the island that extends
      out toward the sea, Cape <i>del Engano</i>. No one who has looked upon the
      slopes of the mountain which stands to the seaward from Sitka can mistake
      the description. He anchored in what is now known as Krestof Bay, about
      six miles northwest from Sitka, and he called it Port <i>Guadalupe</i>.

    <p>
      Captain Cook, on his Third Voyage of Exploration, in 1778, with the ships
      &#8220;Resolution&#8221; and &#8220;Discovery,&#8221; passed along the
      coast and noted the bay, of which he says: &#8220;An arm of this bay, in
      the northern part of it, seemed to extend in toward the north, behind a
      round elevated mountain I called Mount Edgecumbe, and the point of land
      that shoots out from it Cape Edgecumbe.&#8221; This name supplanted the
      one given by the Spaniard and the beautiful cone is yet known by the title
      he bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early Russians called the mountain St. Lazaria, assuming that it was
      the peak seen by Chirikof on his ill fated voyage of discovery and so
      named by him. The small island at the south is still known as San Lazaria
      Island.

      harbor when Captain Portlock, of the English ship &#8220;King George,&#8221;
      which was lying in Portlock Harbor, to the northward in Chichagoff Island,
      sent his ship&#8217;s boat through the passage behind Kruzof Island to
      about the present site of Sitka, and made the discovery for the civilized
      world that Mount Edgecumbe is on an island.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The sea-otter, a marine animal about four feet in length when fully grown,
      with soft, long black pelage of silky texture, is one of the most valued
      of the fur-bearers. It was found abundantly all the way along the
      Northwest Coast, and especially in the passages about Sitka. It is now
      nearly extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians had been gathering the skins of the sea-otter in the northern
      waters for years, ever since Chirikof made his voyage to Sitka, and they
      were truly an El Dorado, in fur, to the traders who plied their trade
      along the coasts. Captain Cook and his sailors, when on their voyage in
      these waters, bought skins for mere trifles, some for a handful of iron
      nails. These same skins sold for as much as sixty dollars each in China
      where they visited on their way home. The story of the furs went over the
      world and English, French and American traders thronged to these waters to
      sail their ships into the straits and barter for the rich pelts. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_14"></a>14</span> To secure a profit
      of $50,000 on a voyage was not unusual. Ingraham, the lieutenant of
      Captain Gray whom we all know so well for his discovery of the great River
      of the West, sailed to near Sitka before his principal entered the river
      which he named for his ship, the Columbia. The French ship &#8220;Solide,&#8221;
      in 1791, sailed from France to gather a portion of the harvest. Her
      captain, Étienne Marchand, anchored in Sitka Bay, and called it <i>Tchinkitinay</i>,
      as he declares it was known to the natives. To his ship flocked the
      painted and skin-clad natives with their peltries for barter. On their
      persons he saw articles of European manufacture, showing that other ships
      had visited there, and in the ears of one young savage were hanging
      pendant two copper coins of the colony of Massachusetts. His success in
      trade was not such as he might have wished, so he sailed way, remarking
      that, &#8220;The modern Hebrews would, perhaps, have little to teach to
      these people in the art of trade.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      March 31st, 1799, the Yankee skipper, Cleveland, of the merchant ship
      &#8220;Caroline,&#8221; sailed into the bay, dropped anchor and fired a
      cannon shot as a signal. He was one of those shrewd, lean traders, skilled
      in navigation, who sailed from Boston round the Horn, with their bucko
      mates, who could drive a <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_15"></a>15</span>
      tack with the prow of a ship, so to speak, and in those days there were no
      corners of the earth where they might not be found seeking for profit. He
      was wise to the ways of the sharp trading canoemen of these waters, and
      their aggressive proclivities, so he prepared his ship with regard for all
      the possibilities of the business. Around it as a bulwark he stretched a
      barrier of dry bull hides brought from the California coast. At the stern
      was a place prepared for the trading. Forward on the deck were planted
      cannon, shotted with shrapnel, trained so as to rake the afterdeck, and
      beside each was a gunner&#8217;s match.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day, for two hundred yards of broadcloth, he purchased a
      hundred prime sea-otter skins, worth $50 each in Canton. Barter was going
      merrily on, when a scream from amidships startled the crew. The Thlingits
      sprang to their boats. The squaws backed the canoes away from the ship&#8217;s
      sides. Arrows were fitted to bowstrings, spears were poised and muskets
      primed. On the ships the sailors lighted the cannon matches and stood by
      ready to fire. A fight was hovering in the air when the cause of the
      disturbance was discovered. An inquisitive Thlingit pried between the bull
      hides opposite the cook&#8217;s galley, and the cook had saluted him with
      a ladle of hot <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_16"></a>16</span>
      water. In his surprise he upset his canoe and his family were struggling
      in the sea. His baby was rescued by a seaman, amends were made to his
      injured feelings, and the barter proceeded as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waters were filled with ships. In a stay of a month the &#8220;Caroline&#8221;
      spoke the ship &#8220;Hancock,&#8221; the ship &#8220;Despatch,&#8221; the
      ship &#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; and the ship &#8220;Eliza,&#8221; all of
      Boston; and the English ship &#8220;Cheerful,&#8221; all trading for furs
      among the Sitkan Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians, in their colony on Kodiak Island, were jealous of the
      intruders on what they considered as their domain. Gregory Shelikof, a
      Siberian merchant, one of the wealthiest and most far seeing of the
      leaders among the Aleutian Islands, conceived the plan of combining the
      whole of the fur trade in one great monopoly. In pursuance of this policy
      he secured a charter from Emperor Paul in 1799, under the name of the
      Russian American Company, which gave the exclusive right to all profits to
      be derived from every form of resource in the Russian possessions in
      America for a period of twenty years. To the management of his business in
      the Colony he established on Kodiak Island he appointed Alexander
      Andreevich Baranof, a Siberian trader of great ability and experience.
      Baranof, the wise and far-seeing Russian ruler of the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_17"></a>17</span> Russian American
      Company, at his factory in St. Paul&#8217;s Harbor on Kodiak Island, had
      long planned the extension of his settlements to the southeast. The
      sea-otter catch of the Russians was made by brigades of Aleuts from the
      western islands, who went along the shores and to sea as far as 20 miles,
      in their wonderful skin boats called bidarkas, to hunt. When a sea-otter
      lifted its head from the water to breathe, within sight of a detachment of
      Aleut hunters, its fate was sealed, for it seldom escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passages between the islands about Sitka were called the &#8220;Straits&#8221;
      by the Russians, and in them the sea-otter skins were taken by the
      thousands. It was not unusual for a Russian hunting party consisting of a
      hundred bidarkas to take on one expedition 2,000 skins of the <i>Morski
      bobrov</i>, as they called the sea-otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animals were becoming scarce in the seas about the western islands and
      Baranof was compelled to replenish his trade by the catch of the
      southeastern waters. In 1795 he sent one of his ships as far south as the
      Queen Charlotte Islands and it visited Sitka on the way. Two thousand
      skins were secured by the hunters while on this voyage. In the same year
      Baranof himself paid Sitka <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_18"></a>18</span>
      a visit, coming through the strait from the north in his little schooner
      &#8220;Olga,&#8221; a 40-foot boat, and he named the passage for his craft
      as Olga Strait. On the shore near his anchorage he erected a cross; the
      bay he named Krestof Bay, and he then selected the locality of his future
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1799, Baranof sent orders to the toyons, or chiefs, of
      the tribes on the islands around Kodiak to assemble the hunters. Five
      hundred and fifty bidarkas, each manned by from two to three Aleut
      paddlers, came in answer to his call, and with two convoying ships he set
      sail for Sitka Sound. On July 7th he landed at a bay six miles north of
      the present town of Sitka, purchased a tract of land from Skayeutlelt, a
      local chief, and began the construction of a post which he named redoubt
      St. Michael. The building was done under great difficulties. Rain fell
      incessantly. There were but thirty Russian workmen as most of the Aleuts
      returned to Kodiak, hunting as they went. Of the men who remained ten had
      to stand guard constantly, for the Thlingits were not to be trusted.
      Barracks, storehouses, quarters for the commanding officer, were
      constructed; a bath house also, for the Russian must have his bath, and
      the whole was <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_19"></a>19</span>
      surrounded by a stockade and strengthened by blockhouses. Their troubles
      were not all with the elements, for during the winter the scarcity of
      provision and other causes brought scurvy to add to their discomfort.
      Their food was mostly yuhali (dried salmon), but during the winter the
      hunters took 40 sea-lions, and in the spring many seals were killed in the
      bay by the Aleuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives, called Thlingits at the present, were known as the Kolosh by
      the Russians. They were divided among themselves in their feelings toward
      the new settlers in their midst. Some looked with extreme disfavor upon
      the establishment, while others were friendly. The young and turbulent
      warriors were hostile. A messenger was sent to invite them to a prasdnik
      (holiday) at the fort. He was taken prisoner by them and detained until
      Baranof landed in their midst with an armed force and demanded his
      release, when they set him free and ridiculed the incident. At a dance at
      the fort many of the Kolosh came with long knives concealed under their
      cloaks. Their treachery was detected and their design frustrated. The
      courage and caution of Baranof held them in check until spring when he
      departed for Kodiak, leaving strict instructions as to the precautions to
      be observed during his <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_20"></a>20</span>
      absence. After his departure the discipline grew more lax and the Kolosh
      became more bold. The watchful savages at last saw an opportunity to rid
      themselves of their new neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a June day of 1802, the exact date is not recorded, a horde of painted
      savages burst from the forest, clad in all the paraphernalia of war masks
      and barbaric armour. A fleet of war canoes landed warriors on the beach in
      front of the redoubt. In the attack that followed the stockade and
      buildings were reduced to smoking ruins, the magazines were robbed of rich
      stores of furs, most of the defenders died on the spears of the Kolosh or
      were tortured till death relieved their sufferings, and the women and
      children were made slaves. Skayeutlelt, the false friend of Baranof,
      directed the battle from a nearby knoll and his nephew, Katlean, was one
      of the principal actors in the bloody tragedy. A few survivors who were
      hunting in their bidarkas or were in the forest, escaped to the ships of
      the English and American traders which were in the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ebbetts on an American ship and Captain Barber of the British ship
      &#8220;Myrtle&#8221; were in the harbor. Some of the survivors on reaching
      these ships asked them to rescue their countrymen. Captain Ebbetts <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_21"></a>21</span> ransomed several
      prisoners, but Captain Barber adopted a more effective course. Chief
      Katlean and Chief Skayeutlelt came on board his ship to trade. He at once
      put them in irons and threatened to hang them to the yardarm of the ship
      if the captives remaining in the hands of the natives, and also the
      plundered sea-otter skins, were not immediately surrendered to him. The
      threat was effective, the greater part of the sea-otter furs and several
      captives were brought on the ship and delivered to him. He then took the
      ransomed captives from the other ship and sailed for Kodiak, where he
      demanded a ransom of 50,000 rubles from Baranof for the captives. The
      ransom was later reduced to 10,000 rubles which was paid by Mr. Baranof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years passed before much is again known of Sitka. English and American
      captains sailed their ships into the harbor and gathered the furs which
      Baranof had endeavored to garner in the storehouses of the Russian
      American Company. In the summer of 1804 Baranof gathered a force at Kodiak
      with which to cross the Gulf of Alaska to re-establish his post. There
      were one hundred and fifty bearded <i>promyshileniks</i>, or fur hunters,
      and over 500 Aleuts in their skin bidarkas. With him were the ships
      &#8220;Alexander,&#8221; &#8220;Ekaterina,&#8221; &#8220;Yermak,&#8221;
      and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_22"></a>22</span> &#8220;Rostislaf.&#8221;
      When they reached Sitka they found there Captain Lisianski of the Imperial
      Russian Navy, with the ship &#8220;Neva,&#8221; one of the first Russians
      to circle the globe, and who came to help to recapture the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian village of Sitka was almost in the same place as the present
      town, grouped around the Baranof hill which was called by the Russians a
      <i>kekoor</i>. On the top of the kekoor was a redoubt, and a stronger fort
      was near the mouth of the Indian River, or <i>Kolosh Ryeku</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of September 28th the Russian ships moved to a point
      opposite the village, the &#8220;Neva&#8221; being towed by a hundred
      bidarkas. The Sitkans abandoned their village and the fort on the hill and
      withdrew to the stronger fortification near the river. Baranof landed a
      force and occupied the kekoor, planted cannon on the top, then opened
      negotiations for the surrender of the other fort, but his overtures were
      rejected by the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ships were brought near the river fort and the cannon were trained on
      it. The fort was built of thick logs in the shape of an irregular square,
      with portholes on the side next the sea, and inside the breast works were
      14 barabaras, or native houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls were of such thickness that the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_23"></a>23</span> cannon shot from the &#8220;Neva&#8221; made
      but little impression on the structure. Baranof was impatient and urged an
      attack. Reinforcements were landed from the ships under command of
      Lieutenants Arbusof and Polavishin. The hunters, sailors, and Aleuts flung
      themselves against the fortifications, but meeting a murderous fire were
      driven back in disorder and only saved from disaster by the protection of
      the fire of the ships. Ten men were killed and 26 wounded, and among the
      wounded was Baranof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lisianski then took command and moved his ships nearer the shore.
      A canoe with reinforcements and a supply of powder for the Indians
      approached among the islands but a shot from the &#8220;Neva&#8221; struck
      it, the powder exploded, and the Indians who were saved from the wreck
      were taken on board the Russian ship. The bombardment was steadily
      continued until the 6th of October, when the Kolosh proposed to surrender,
      and a parley was held, but during the night they evacuated the fort and
      went over the mountains to the north. In the fort were left the bodies of
      30 warriors and also the bodies of five children who had been killed to
      prevent their cries making the retreat known to the Russians. The only
      remaining survivors were two old women and a little <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_24"></a>24</span> boy. A few
      straggling warriors remained lurking about, seeking revenge, and a few
      days later they killed eight Aleuts who were fishing on Jamestown Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the Kolosh went over the mountains was long a mystery to the Russians.
      They reached the shore of Peril Strait and crossing to the north shore
      placed a fort near the entrance to Sitkoh Bay which was stronger than
      their old fort at Indian River and where over 1,000 people gathered. A
      tradition among the old Indians says that the fugitives first went to Old
      Sitka, then over the mountains to the northeastern side of the island. On
      the way they suffered extremely from fatigue and hunger, and one Sitka
      Indian who lives on Peril Strait relates that his father was a child at
      the time of the exodus. His father carried him till exhausted, when he
      abandoned him, and his mother then took him up and carried him the
      remainder of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The property left in the fort by the Kolosh was taken out, the
      fortification was burned and the canoes on the beach were broken to
      pieces. There was enough remaining of the structure that some of the
      remains of the foundation may yet be seen in the forest which has sprung
      up around it in the Indian River Park, although more than a century has
      since elapsed.

      restoration of the post, on the present site of Sitka, and with energy and
      despatch the building of a new Russian settlement proceeded. Around the
      kekoor the native houses were removed, and along with them more than a
      hundred burial houses with the ashes of the bodies which had been burned.
      The great tribal houses, or barabaras, as they are called in the Russian
      accounts, were spacious, some measuring 50 feet in width and 80 feet in
      length.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
      In their place rose the town of New Archangel (<i>Novo Arkangelsk</i>,)
      and on the kekoor was built a redoubt. This was the official name and
      generally recognized by the Russians, but the name Sitka was early used by
      them. Baranof frequently used the term Sitka in his letters, and in the
      letter of the Minister of Finance to the Minister of Marine, from St.
      Petersburg, April 9, 1820, Sitka is used in several places. The name
      Sitka, or Sheetkah, in the Thlingit language, means, in this place, that
      this is the place, or the best place, implying superiority over all other
      places.

      III<br /><span class="h2fs">PROGRESS OF THE COLONY</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The courtly Chamberlain of the Tsar, Nicholas P. Resanof, son-in-law of
      Shelikof who was the founder of the first Russian colony in America, came
      to Sitka in 1805, via Petropavlovsk, Siberia, on the &#8220;Nadeshda,&#8221;
      one of the first Russian ships to circumnavigate the world, and was a
      special representative of the Russian American Company, of which
      organization he was one of the founders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his report to the Company he tells us: &#8220;The fort is on the high
      hill, or kekoor, on a peninsula in the gulf. On the left side of the
      kekoor close on the peninsula is built an immense barracks with two
      projecting blockhouses or towers. All the building is made from mast
      timber from the top to the foundation, under which is a cellar. Besides
      this building are two warehouses, a material magazine and two cellars,
      also two large sheds for storing food, and under the sheds are the
      quarters for the workmen. On the side <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_28"></a>28</span> opposite the fort is a shed for storing cargo,
      at the right side is the kitchen, bath, and quarters for the servants of
      the Company, clerks, etc., and on the shore are the blacksmith shops and
      other workshops. On the top of the kekoor is a building five sazhens<a
      id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
      long and three sazhens wide, with two rooms. In one I live, and in the
      other there are two shipmasters. There are still some old Kolosh <i>yourts</i>,
      in which live the <i>kayours</i> and the Kodiak Americans (Aleuts, they
      are generally called).<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"
      class="fnanchor"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Our guns are always loaded, everywhere are sentinels with loaded
      arms, and in the rooms of each of us arms constitute the greater part of
      the furniture. All the night the signals from post to post continue, war
      discipline prevails; in a word, we are ready at any minute to receive our
      dear guests, who generally profit by the darkness of night to make an
      attack.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The additional number in the garrison owing to the arrival of the
      Chamberlain and his suite made it more difficult to procure provisions for
      the winter. The hostile Kolosh made hunting and fishing dangerous. In the
      autumn there was but flour enough for an allowance of a pound a week for
      one month <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_29"></a>29</span> for
      the 200 men in the fort. For other food supply they were dependent on the
      fish caught in the bay, the dried <i>yukali</i> and sealion meat from
      Kodiak, and the dried seal meat from the Seal Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baranof bought the ship &#8220;Juno,&#8221; an American sailing ship of
      about 250 tons, from Captain George D&#8217;Wolf, of Bristol, Conn., with
      its cargo of flour, sugar and other articles, for the sum of 68,000
      piastres (Spanish), equivalent to about the same number of dollars. This
      relieved the immediate necessity, but before spring the supply became so
      low that the scurvy, that dread malady of the seas and of outlying
      localities, attacked the garrison. This scourge often fell heavily on the
      early Russian expeditions, and in 1821 the Russian ship &#8220;Borodino&#8221;
      lost 40 men through its ravages in a voyage from Sitka to Kronstadt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, Resanof sailed for San Francisco in the &#8220;Juno&#8221; to
      purchase breadstuffs and other supplies. He also wished to examine the
      coast with the view of making other settlements farther south, at Nootka,
      at the Columbia, or even farther south in California. He secured a cargo
      of the products of the south and returned to Sitka in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his southward journey Resanof reconnoitred the mouth of the Columbia
      River, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_30"></a>30</span> seeking
      a site for a future settlement. He was unable to enter the river owing to
      contrary winds; and the condition of his crew, debilitated by lack of
      proper food and suffering from scurvy, caused him to hasten on. He heard
      that a party of U.&nbsp;S. soldiers were building a fort there. This rumor
      doubtless came from the presence of Lewis and Clarke near the present
      Astoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      While on this visit to San Francisco Resanof met the Spanish beauty, Dona
      Concepcion de Arguello, of whom one of the visitors said, &#8220;She was
      lively and animated, had sparkling, love-inspiring eyes, beautiful teeth,
      pleasing and expressive features, a fine form and a thousand other charms,&#8221;
      and he lost his heart to her. The romance of the Russian courtier and the
      fair Californian furnished to Bret Harte the theme for some of his most
      beautiful verse. Resanof, hurrying home to Russia to gain the Imperial
      permission to his marriage, died at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and Dona
      Concepcion waited for years for the coming of her lover, not knowing that
      he lay dead under the Siberian snows. When the news of his sad fate came
      to her she donned the habit of a nun and devoted herself to charitable
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visit to California was the beginning of a trade that continued for
      many years, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_31"></a>31</span>
      through all the period of Russian occupation. During the days of the gold
      discoveries in California large shipments of goods were made from Sitka to
      San Francisco, and after the sale of the territory to the United States
      great quantities of merchandise were shipped from the warehouses of the
      Company to the California metropolis, amounting to over a quarter of a
      million dollars in one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breadstuffs for the colonies were procured from California, from San
      Francisco and from Ross Colony, or from Peru, until 1840, when a contract
      was made with the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company under which the supplies were
      brought from the farms of the Nisqually or from Vancouver, in Oregon
      Territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the time of the arrival of the &#8220;Neva&#8221;, 1804, all trading
      goods were brought across Siberia to Okhotsk, and thence by sailing vessel
      to the colony, or were purchased from the American or English trading
      ships which came to the coast for furs. To the natives the English who
      came to these waters became known as &#8220;King George Men,&#8221; and
      the Americans were called &#8220;Boston Men,&#8221; the latter being from
      the great number of ships that sailed from the great shipping port of New
      England. From these traders goods were purchased by Baranof at lower rates
      than those cost which were brought <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_32"></a>32</span> from Russia. John Jacob Astor was one of the
      first to engage in the trade. He sent the ship &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; to
      Sitka in 1810, and the &#8220;Beaver&#8221; in 1812. From Washington
      Irving we have the description, through the account of the Captain, of the
      &#8220;Hyperborean veteran ensconsed in a fort which crested the top of a
      high rock promontory,&#8221; which is well known to all readers of stories
      of western life, and in which the impression of the character of Baranof
      as given to the reader is very erroneous. The traders exchanged their
      goods with the Russians for furs, sometimes going to the Pribilof Islands
      to receive the seal-skins; sailed to China, where the furs were traded for
      silks, nankins, and teas; they then voyaged on around the world to their
      home port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sloop-of-war &#8220;Diana,&#8221; the first Russian warship to reach
      Sitka, arrived in 1810 under the command of Captain Vasili M. Golofnin,
      who was widely known for his adventures while a captive in the Kingdom of
      the Nipponese, where he was carried about in a bamboo cage and exhibited
      to the populace. His description of his visit to Sitka is entertaining,
      and of it he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In the fort we met nothing so unusual or costly as to be worthy of
      special remark; the fort consisted of solid log towers, and <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_33"></a>33</span> high strong
      palisades, with apertures or embrasures, in which were set guns and
      carronades of different calibres. The interior construction, barracks,
      storehouses, house of the commander and other buildings were made of thick
      logs and were very solid, these being very common in this place, around
      which grows, so to say, within reach of a windlass, a multitude of most
      beautiful trees suitable for structures of every description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In the house of Mr. Baranof were ornaments and furniture in
      profusion, of masterly workmanship and costly price, brought from St.
      Petersburg and from England, which corresponded with his position as the
      head official of a great company. What astonished us most was an extensive
      library in nearly all European languages, and many pictures of remarkable
      merit. I must confess, that I badly judge in painting, and only could
      know, that in the uncultivated wild border of America, there would be none
      except Mr. Baranof to value and understand them, unless there might happen
      to be educated travelers, or masters of United States trading vessels
      visiting this place, there would be no one to appreciate the fine art. Mr.
      Baranof, noting my astonishment, explained the riddle, saying, that the
      pictures attracting our attention were gifts of the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_34"></a>34</span> Company and of
      distinguished persons in St. Petersburg, for the establishing of a
      library, and the Directory sent them out. On these works he commented with
      the following remarkable view: &#8216;Better that our directors had sent
      us a doctor, for in all the Company&#8217;s colonies there is not one
      doctor, nor one doctor&#8217;s assistant, nor one doctor&#8217;s pupil.&#8217;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Golofnin soon left Sitka to return to St. Petersburg. His successful
      voyage, together with that of the &#8220;Neva&#8221; and the &#8220;Nadeshda,&#8221;
      encouraged the shipment of goods by sea from Russia, and from that time
      onward ships came regularly, laden with supplies of every kind for the
      post, and returned with rich cargoes of peltry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1825 surgical and astronomical instruments of the best quality were
      sent to the colony, an apothecary shop of three rooms provided medicines,
      and four Creole boys, under the charge of a doctor, attended to the
      dispensing of the potions. A hospital was in connection and the sick
      received fresh food, tea, sugar, and medicines, free, upon the order of
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      An observatory, equipped with the most improved magnetic and
      meteorological instruments was later provided and there was kept a record
      of natural phenomena, while <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_35"></a>35</span>
      a museum of objects of interest from the surrounding country was open for
      the instruction of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library was brought from St. Petersburg in 1806 by Resanof. Mr.
      Khlebnikof tells us that it contained more than 1,200 volumes, valued at
      7,500 rubles, and they were in the Russian, French, German, English, Latin
      and other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Resanof was preparing for his journey he addressed letters to
      many of the leading men of St. Petersburg, soliciting their contribution
      of books to promote the beginning of education in the far off possession
      of the Czar. Many sent a response in writing accompanied by one or more
      volumes, and the letters so sent were richly bound in a separate volume
      and placed with the library in the building at Sitka. Among the patrons
      were the Metropolite Ambrosia, Count Rumiantzof, Count Stroganof, Admiral
      Chichagof, Minister of Justice Dimitrief, Senator Zakarof and others. The
      sentiments were varied, but many agreed in voicing the desire to &#8220;sow
      the seed of science in the breasts of the peoples so far outlying from the
      enlightenment of Europe.&#8221; Some of them reflected the personal
      character of the donors: The Metropolite Ambrosia sent books for church
      services; the Minister of Marine sent plans of <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_36"></a>36</span> ships; and Count
      Rumiantzof contributed works on husbandry.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kyril Khlebnikof, the accountant of the Company, who was in charge of
      the counting house at Sitka from 1818 to 1832, to whom we are indebted for
      many valuable writings relating to the early history of the settlements,
      tells us that when Mr. Baranof left the colony the buildings had become
      badly decayed and much new construction had to be done. In 1827 there had
      been built, three sentry houses, a battery of thirty guns on the kekoor,
      and below them magazines, barracks and other buildings, a bakery, wharf,
      arsenal, etc. In the shops were blacksmiths, coppersmiths, locksmiths,
      coopers, turners, rope spinners, chandlers, painters, masons, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Ozerskoe Redoubt, on Deep Lake, were barracks and a fort, a
      flouring mill, a tannery, and other buildings. A zapor, or fish trap, in
      the stream took sixty thousand fish each year.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_37"></a>37</span>The workmen got
      out timber from the forest for the building of ships, they cut fuel and
      burned charcoal in large quantities; kept the buildings in repair and did
      other duties required on the factory. The work of the gardening was
      chiefly done by the Aleuts, who were paid a ruble a day for their
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian Captain Lutke came to Sitka about this time and he tells us
      that there were many pigs and chickens raised by the inhabitants, and that
      a pig might be had for 5 to 7 rubles, a hen for 4 to 5 rubles, and eggs at
      from 3-1/2 to 10 rubles per dozen. The chief drawback to the chicken
      industry was the presence of the great black ravens that carried away the
      young chicks and sometimes even the old hens. The ravens were such
      successful scavengers that they were called the New Archangel police, and
      he says they even bit the tails off the young pigs, so that all the hogs
      of the place were tailless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mentions the abundance of deer on the islands and also says that
      mountain sheep were killed by the Aleuts and brought to the fort. He must
      have confused the sheep with the goats, for the sheep never approach the
      coast so closely, and he speaks of the wool being used for weaving the
      blankets for the ceremonial dances of the Kolosh. This would indicate that
      the animal in question was the mountain goat. A later writer says that
      2,700 game animals were brought into Sitka for sale during the winter of
      1861-62.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_38"></a>38</span>A shipyard was
      established as soon as the necessary buildings to house the garrison were
      completed. It occupied a part of the present parade ground near the
      Russian Barracks and included a portion of the present street. Many
      vessels were built in the yard during the Russian occupation, the first,
      being the tender &#8220;Avoss,&#8221; launched in 1806, followed by the
      brig &#8220;Sitka,&#8221; built by an American shipbuilder named Lincoln,
      and for which he was paid 2,000 rubles as a royalty upon the completion of
      the ship. A frigate of 320 tons was the largest vessel built before 1819,
      and at that time construction was discontinued until 1834, when work was
      resumed and continued until the close of the Russian regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &#8220;Politofsky&#8221; was one of the last vessels to be built at
      Sitka, and it was sold by Prince Maksoutoff to H. M. Hutchinson and
      Abraham Hirsch for $4,000 in 1867. The next year it was sold to
      Hutchinson, Kohl &amp; Co., and later was sold to a firm that ran it to
      Puget Sound, and from Alaska to San Francisco. It was built of Alaska
      cedar timber, the <i>dushnoi dereva</i> or scented wood of the Russians,
      and was spiked with hand-made copper spikes. It was taken to Alaska in the
      gold rush of 1898, and found its last resting place, very appropriately,
      in the land where <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_39"></a>39</span>
      it was built, in the harbor of St. Michael, the old Russian port on Bering
      Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear of shipwreck, and of death at sea hung over every soul of the
      community. The long voyages in uncharted and unlighted waters with sailing
      ships&#8211;more than six months at the shortest from Kronstadt&#8211;often
      three months or more against baffling winds from Okhotsk&#8211;the voyages
      to the redoubts and <i>odinoshkas</i> (detached posts with one man only)
      of the Bering Sea and of the Gulf of Alaska, to collect the fur catch of
      the year and bring it to Sitka; the long journey via Canton on the return
      to Russia&#8211;all held many dangers for the sailing ships of those days.
      The &#8220;Phoenix,&#8221; the first ship built on the Alaskan shores,
      foundered with all on board, including the Bishop and his retinue, in
      1799, on the return voyage from Okhotsk; the &#8220;St. Nicholas&#8221;
      went ashore on the coast of Washington in 1808, and those who survived the
      waves were held in bondage for years by the savages of that coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the latter part of August, 1812, the ship &#8220;Neva&#8221; left
      Okhotsk&#8211;contrary winds delayed her in the Sea of Okhotsk&#8211;storms
      beat her back along the Aleutian Islands till it was November before land
      was sighted in Alaska. The storms damaged the rigging and ship until it
      was necessary to put <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_40"></a>40</span>
      into Voskresenski Harbor (Resurrection Bay) for repairs. She arrived off
      Sitka about December 1st. After four or five days Mt. Edgecumbe was
      sighted but a storm drove the ship to sea where she beat about for weeks
      before again nearing the port. Scurvy afflicted the passengers and crew
      and added to the general distress. On January 8th, 1813, Mt. Edgecumbe
      again appeared. In trying to make the harbor the ship grounded on the
      rocks under the cape on the morning of the 9th and speedily broke to
      pieces under the terrific pounding of the seas.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Some of the people
      on board reached shore after incredible suffering and hardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several days two of the sailors wandering along the shore met a
      Kolosh boy and persuaded him to take them to Sitka, where they arrived,
      cold, exhausted, and almost starving. Boats were at once fitted out by Mr.
      Baranof, the survivors were rescued, brought to Sitka, and their
      sufferings relieved. From those on board the ship, 38 had perished,
      including Kalinin, the commander, Boronovolokof, the intended future chief
      manager of the Company, and five <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_41"></a>41</span> women passengers. In the cargo was food and
      clothing, the messages of the year for the exiles, and rich vestments and
      furnishings for the church that was soon to be built in Sitka, all
      scattered for miles along the wild coast of Kruzof Island. This was one of
      the worst disasters of the sea that visited the colony, although many
      others are part of the records of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that Chief Katlean tore his hair with rage when he learned of
      the wreck, because he did not find it and destroy the survivors out of
      revenge for his defeat and expulsion from his home at Sitka.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many traditions among the residents of Sitka concerning the
      wreck of the &#8220;Neva.&#8221; Among them is that there was a vast
      treasure of gold for the use of the garrison and the traders. This is
      erroneous, for there was no gold used in the colonies, the trade being by
      barter or conducted with scrip, called <i>assignats</i>, issued by the
      Company for the purpose. The story of the gold has been so generally
      believed that serious plans have been made for attempting the salvage of
      the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term of office of Alexander Andreevich Baranof as the chief manager of
      the Russian American Company came to a close in 1818. He had been 28 years
      in the colonies, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_42"></a>42</span>
      leaving Russia in 1790 for the post of Three Saints on Kodiak Island,
      which at that time constituted almost the only Russian establishment in
      America, the other stations being little more than outlying trading posts.
      He left their dominion an empire in extent, reaching from the Seal Islands
      in Bering Sea, at the edge of the ice pack of the Arctic, to Fort Ross,
      among the sunny hills of Golden California. Captain Hagmeister came to
      relieve him, and in his 72nd year the old chief manager, bent with the
      weight of years and of long and arduous service, closed his accounts and
      set sail on the &#8220;Kutusof,&#8221; one of the Company&#8217;s vessels,
      for his far-off home in Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time arrived for Baranof to take his departure from the land he
      had made his home for so many years, sorrowfully he took his leave of the
      associates with whom he had so long shared the dangers and hardships of
      the uncivilized land. Upon being relieved of the duties of his office he
      first considered building a home at the Ozerskoe Redoubt and spending the
      remainder of his days in the place he had learned to love. Later he
      decided to return to his native land and sailed on the &#8220;Kutusof&#8221;
      for Kronstadt. A delay at Batavia in the tropics proved too severe for his
      advanced years. The day after leaving Batavia he <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_43"></a>43</span> died and was buried
      at sea in the waters of the Indian Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Leontius Andreanovich Hagemeister succeeded to the office of chief
      manager but remained only a short time at Sitka, then sailed for Russia,
      leaving Captain Simeon Ivanovich Yanovski in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Yanovski became enamored with the beautiful daughter of Baranof,
      and if you search the old records of the Cathedral of St. Michaels at
      Sitka you will find the entry as made of the marriage of Simeon Ivanof
      Yanovski &#8220;with the late head governor of the Russian American
      possessions, Collegiate Adviser and Cavalier Baranof&#8217;s daughter
      Irina, one of Creoles.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1830, Baron Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangell, scientist and explorer, came
      to administer the office. He had sailed the frozen ocean along the
      northern shores of Siberia as an explorer, and Wrangell Island, Wrangell
      Strait, etc., on the maps of today perpetuate his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Baron Wrangell, as assistant to the manager, served Adolph Carlovich
      Etolin, a native of Finland, who came to the colony as an officer on the
      war sloop &#8220;Kamchatka&#8221; in 1817, who sailed in the service of
      the Company to nearly every port from the Seal Islands of Bering Sea to
      Chile, who made <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_44"></a>44</span>
      several voyages around the world, and who was made chief manager in 1840.
      In 1846 he returned to Russia to accept the trust of Commercial Counsellor
      in the head office of the Company in St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fourteen miles to the southwest, across the bay and facing
      Edgecumbe, with a beautiful view of the peak and islands, is the Hot
      Springs, well known for their medicinal properties by the natives before
      the advent of the Russians, and frequently resorted to by both as a
      panacea for many ills. In the Place of Islands <i>(Chasti Ostrova)</i> is
      reputed to be a spring with a sour taste, while almost within the limits
      of the town of Sitka, Dr. Scheffer, a German physician who made a sojourn
      in the place about 1815, claimed to have found a medical spring whose
      waters were equal to some of the famed watering places of Germany.

    <p>
      Most of the Sitkan Kolosh kept aloof from the Russian settlement after the
      establishment of the new fort on Chatham Strait, near the entrance of
      Peril Strait. All the kwans, the Khootznoos, the Hoonahs, the Chilkats,
      the Auks, Stikines, Kakes and others, joined with the Sitkas in the hatred
      of the Russians. Parties going out from the fort at Sitka for hunting
      expeditions, for cutting of wood, for traveling to the Hot Springs, had to
      be on their guard and with arms at hand prepared to fight at a moment&#8217;s
      notice.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
      Small groups were often cut off and murdered. As it was impossible to
      decide which of the many kwans did the act, and as there were those in
      each kwan who were peaceable, with whom it was desired to keep the peace,
      revenge against any village was inadvisable. Even as late as the date of
      the lease to the Hudson's Bay Co. the Russian ships that sailed among the
      islands to trade with the Kolosh <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_46"></a>46</span> were compelled to act with the strictest
      caution. Only a few natives were admitted on board at a time, the trading
      was done in a space near the stern, and was conducted under the muzzles of
      loaded cannon concealed in the fore part of the ship.<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The conditions
      were thus until 1821, when the Sitkas were invited to reoccupy the site of
      the old village and to live in what is now known as the &#8220;Ranche,&#8221;
      under the guns of the redoubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thlingit nation is a strange, warlike, shrewd people, physically
      strong and enduring, and possessed of many excellent qualities. Hunters
      and fishermen by nature and training, they are skillful boatmen, and in
      those days they built wonderfully beautiful canoes of the red cedar, some
      of them large enough to carry sixty men at the paddles. Each spring more
      than a thousand men gathered together in Sitka Bay, coming from the
      different villages, to fish for herring at the spawning time, when those
      fish run in countless myriads in those waters. Hemlock boughs were placed
      in the water, and on them the herring roe collected until they were
      encrusted with the eggs which were then stripped off and dried for future
      use.

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_47"></a>47</span>In 1807 there
      were over 2,000 hostile natives gathered in the harbor at the herring
      season and they threatened an attack on the settlement. Kuskof, the most
      trusted and able lieutenant of Baranof, was in charge, and it put his
      wisdom and watchfulness to the test to avert disaster. The strictest
      discipline was maintained. The tribesmen waited outside day after day,
      hoping for news of some relaxation of the precautions of the defenders to
      be brought to them by the women of the tribe who were married to the
      Russian promishleniki (hunters). Day and night the sentinels paced the
      beats on the stockade and along the waterfront, till, weary of waiting,
      the Kolosh finally dispersed to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great tribal houses several families lived, sometimes as many as
      fifty or sixty persons. Over the door of the house was painted the family
      totem, for the Sitkas did not raise the house totem in a pole in front as
      did many of the kwans of the Thlingits, and as the Hydahs do. In these
      houses were held the potlatches, or gift parties, which were made by the
      wealthy chiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potlatches were of different kinds, although all partook of the nature
      of a feasting or merrymaking and were distinguished by the giving of
      gifts. In the ordinary visiting potlatches, or in the berry potlatches,
      the visitors came in their canoes with which <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_48"></a>48</span> they formed a line off shore opposite the
      houses, put planks from one canoe to another and on these planks danced
      the tribal dance. Those on shore danced the welcome dance and invited the
      guests ashore. Then the visitors disembarked and each family became the
      guest of their kinsmen of their totem or they went to the guesthouse of
      the kwan. All the people of the same totem are supposed to be blood
      relations, so all those of the wolf totem go to the <i>Gooch-heat</i>, or
      the dwelling blazoned by the rude heraldry with the wolf rampant. In the
      great social potlatches a wealthy chief invites his friends from many
      villages and entertains them for a week or more with dancing and feasting
      and makes presents varied and valuable, from Hudson&#8217;s Bay blankets
      to bolts of calico or of flannel, and in primitive days, copper tows,<a
      id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
      Chilkat blankets, and even slaves were handed over with a lavish
      hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      On special occasions in the olden time, with great ceremony the visitors
      landed at a distance from the village, drew their canoes ashore and
      proceeded to the village dressed in festive garments adorned with sealion
      heads or other strange headdresses, in which <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_49"></a>49</span> they danced the rare and picturesque &#8220;Beach
      Dance,&#8221; in acknowledgement to the Spirit of the Sea for the
      bountiful supply of salmon and herring of the past season&#8211;for the
      native American is a thankful being and omits not to show it when occasion
      offers to acknowledge it to the Giver of all good and perfect gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the earlier years of the colony the Kolosh were implacable enemies.
      War parties of young men constantly haunted the islands of the bay, lying
      in wait for any unwary hunter or fisherman from the fort. Later, when they
      were settled under the walls of the fort they became more tractable, for
      their homes and families were commanded by the guns of the fortress, but
      on the least provocation the savagery in their blood would boil, from
      their great tribal houses they issued forth, faces blackened to the
      semblance of devils, war masks grinning, and the howling mob shouted
      defiance at their neighbor over the stockade. Many a bloody tragedy was
      enacted in the &#8220;Ranche&#8221; for their code was primitive, &#8220;an
      eye for an eye,&#8221; and a life for a life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feuds raged between the different totemic families. About 1853 a party of
      Wrangell Indians (Stikines) visited Sitka, and while <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_50"></a>50</span> being entertained in
      the guest-house were murdered and their bodies piled into a canoe which
      was then paddled to Japonski Island. On striking the shore it was so
      heavily laden with the bodies of the dead that tradition says the canoe
      split from end to end. It is said that the bones of the dead are still to
      be seen in the undergrowth along the shore. In retaliation, about 1855,
      the Wrangell Kolosh made an attack on the Hot Springs settlement, burned
      the buildings, stripped the inhabitants of property and clothing and left
      them to make their way over the mountains around the head of Silver Bay to
      Sitka, where they arrived more dead than alive from hunger and exhaustion.
      This feud was not settled until 1918, when a peace treaty was consummated
      between the kwans on Armistice Day, a coincidence which is much made of by
      the tribesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kolosh were as firm believers in witchcraft as any of the more
      civilized nations. They resorted to their shamans (<i>ekhts</i>) or
      medicine men in case of illness. If his weird incantations failed to
      relieve the sufferer, his resort was that the victim was bewitched and
      some poor unfortunate paid the penalty by enduring the most fiendish
      torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      One March day in 1855 a commotion arose in the Kolosh village. A sentry
      caught <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_51"></a>51</span> an
      Indian who was stealing and punished him, for which the tribe called for
      vengeance. Some rushed to the stockade and began to cut away the
      palisades. Other forced their way into the Koloshian Church through the
      outer door. From this vantage point they fired on the garrison and in
      return the batteries of the fort blazed back with solid shot and shrapnel.
      For two hours the fight continued, when the Kolosh gave up all hope of
      success, and ceased the battle. The Russian loss in killed and wounded was
      20 men, while the Kolosh loss was estimated at 60. This was the last
      attempt of the natives to destroy the Russian stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times during the later days of the colony the Kolosh were employed as
      seamen and as workers in the ice trade by the Russians and thus they
      occupied a place in the industrial life. Etolin was the most successful in
      conciliating them of any of the chief managers, and he at one time held a
      fur fair at Sitka to which peltry was brought from far and near, modeled
      somewhat upon the idea of the great fur mart of Nizhni Novgorod. Most of
      them, however, hunted and fished, lived in their tribal houses, carved
      their canoes, wove their baskets, and practiced their witchcraft, while
      their civilized <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_52"></a>52</span>
      neighbors gathered the furs and built ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the walls of the fort, in the old tribal houses of the Kolosh which
      had not been destroyed, lived the Aleuts. Properly speaking the name
      belongs to the natives of the Aleutian Islands, but the term was also
      applied to the natives of Kodiak Island and the surrounding islets. These
      speak a different language from the true Aleuts, but otherwise resemble
      them closely. During the hunting season they scoured the seas in their
      skin bidarkas, in the pursuit of fur animals. In winter many of them
      remained at Sitka instead of returning to their homes. Their time was
      spent in idleness, spending the summer&#8217;s earnings in the pleasures
      and vices of the white man. One who saw them in their kazhims, as their
      dwellings were often called, describes them: &#8220;Morally, the Aleut is
      not bloodthirsty. He delights in simple rejoicings and will play you a
      game of chess with walrus ivory pieces&#8211;a duck for a pawn and a
      penguin for a king&#8211;with the greatest of good humor. Even when
      squabbles arrive the argument is carried on in poetry to the accompaniment
      of dancing, and one would be inclined to prefer the Aleut angry to the
      Aleut amiable, did he not know he also dances when festive and when
      religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_53"></a>53</span>&#8220;Among
      them the social duty of visiting has its drawbacks. Several families live
      together in the kazhims, and during one&#8217;s visit they all lie around
      in every conceivable posture, jolly and genial, naked and unashamed. The
      fumes of the blubber oil lamps and stoves, the stores of raw meat, the
      many naked bodies, well smeared with grease and scented with primitive
      unguents, combine to make an atmosphere difficult to tolerate and not easy
      to describe. Yet, if you will, you may enjoy the warmest hospitality, and
      have heaped upon you the most assiduous attentions.&#8221;

      It was not until 1816 that a priest arrived at Sitka, and in that year the
      first entry is made in the church records under the name of Alexander
      Sokolof. A church was built at the south of the street, which was then
      called the Governor&#8217;s Walk, almost opposite the present cathedral. A
      monument marks the spot where the altar stood, and a cross marks the site
      of a grave, said to be that of a priest. Tradition also tells that there
      are two graves there, and assigns the other one to the daughter of Baron

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_55"></a>55</span>The present
      cathedral of St. Michael, which is the central point of historic interest,
      in the center of the town at Lincoln Street, was dedicated November 20,
      1848. It fronts on a small court and with its green painted spire
      surmounted by the Greek Cross is so typically Russian that it might
      readily be believed to have been transplanted from old Russia. The chime
      of bells, a gift from the Church at Moscow, would be worthy of any shrine.
      The building is in the form of a cross, has three sanctuaries and three
      altars. The larger and central sanctuary is that of the <i>Archistrategos</i>
      Michael. In the center is an elevated platform, the episcopal <i>Cathedra</i>,
      and it is separated from the main body of the church by a partition called
      the <i>Ikonastas</i>, which is ornamented with twelve <i>ikons</i>, or
      holy paintings, covered by plates of silver in <i>repousse</i> work in the
      true Russian style of art, and through the Royal Gates the priest appears.
      The silver in the ikons is valued at over $6,000. The ikon of St. Michael
      is said to have been in the wreck of the &#8220;Neva,&#8221; and was
      rescued after being cast up by the sea. Another is a gift of the monks of
      the monastery of Solovetsk; another was brought by Bishop Innocentius
      (Veniaminof) from Petropavlovsk. The ikon of the Resurrection is painted
      on a board from a tree in Hebron, was consecrated in Bethlehem, and bears
      the autograph signature of the Patriarch of Jerusalem.

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_56"></a>56</span>The chapel at

      The vestments and sacred vessels are rich and elegant. The white Easter
      vestment is of cloth of silver and the cloth of gold for high feast days
      was the personal gift of Alexander Andreevich Baranof, the great Russian
      who established the colony. The belfry clock is said to be the work of the
      hands of Veniaminof. The priest in richly brocaded vestments holds the
      services, and a choir of boys chant the chorus with a melody that would be
      the envy of many a far more pretentious edifice. The worshipers stand
      during the services, the clouds of incense rise toward the rounded dome,
      then one by one the worshipers pass and kiss the jeweled cross in the hand
      of the priest. Father Metropolski presided over the church for many years,
      and Father Sergius is one of the best known in recent years.

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_57"></a>57</span>There were two
      other churches during Russian days, one, a Lutheran, built during Etolin&#8217;s
      time, which stood near the site of the first church, and is said to have
      contained a small but very excellent pipe organ, brought from Germany. The
      other church stood near the blockhouse on the hill, was on the line of the
      stockade, and had two doors, one inside the fortification, the other
      outside and used as an entrance by the natives. It was known as the
      Koloshian Church, and its site is marked by a monument. Both these
      buildings long ago fell into ruin and were removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian religion was closely associated with the Government, so in the
      colonies the official charter of the Company compelled them to provide
      well for the church and the priests according to the standard of the
      times, and the work was carried on with zeal and fortitude by the
      missionaries who came from the monasteries of the old Russian cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the missionaries who came to Russian America, the greatest was Ivan
      Veniaminof. Father John he is often called in the old records, a wonderful
      man, broad of mind and of body, combining the qualities that inspire awe
      and reverence with a gentleness of word and deed that made him beloved
      wherever he was known. His zapiski, or letters, are among the best
      authorities extant which remain from those years on Alaskan matters, and
      they were written home to Russia during his stay in the Aleutian Islands
      and at Sitka. He came to Sitka after a ten-year stay at Unalaska, remained
      there for five years working for the church and teaching <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_58"></a>58</span> in the schools, then
      returned to Moscow and was consecrated as bishop of the new diocese. He
      again arrived in Sitka in 1842, and made a tour of all the churches in the
      colonies, traveling by sailing ship to every settlement, then went home to
      Russia where he became Metropolite of Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schools of Sitka, under the Russian regime, were well maintained, and
      many of the mechanics, clerks, pilots, and men of other trades were
      educated there. Kadin, who drew the charts for Tebenkof&#8217;s Atlas of
      Alaska from the surveys made by the Russian Navigators; Tarantief, who
      engraved the maps on copper-plate at Sitka; and many of the shipmasters
      and accountants in the employ of the Company, were the product of the
      educational institutions of Sitka. In the time of the greatest prosperity
      there were five schools. The church school was advanced to the grade of a
      seminary in 1849 and there were taught navigation, mathematics, astronomy,
      bookkeeping, and other branches of learning. Some of the best pupils, both
      Russian and Creole, were sent to St. Petersburg for more advanced
      instruction. Chief Manager Etolin was the especial patron of education,
      and made many improvements in the system. Under the auspices of Madame
      Etolin, who was a native of Helsingfors and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_59"></a>59</span> was educated in the schools of that city, a
      school was opened and maintained by the Company for the girls of the
      colony. After the transfer to the United States of the Territory the
      teachers returned to Russia and the schools were closed.

      At the top of the kekoor, or the Baranof Hill as it was called in recent
      years, there stood a building occupied during Russian days as a residence
      by the chief managers of the Russian American Company. The one known to
      the residents and visitors of the earlier days of the American occupation
      was known as the Baranof Castle, although Baranof himself never lived in
      it. There were three, if not four different buildings which occupied that
      position. The first to be placed there was built at once upon the founding
      of the post and is described by Resanof in his letters to the Company as
      being a very &#8220;Unpretentious building, and poorly constructed.&#8221;
      Before the close of Baranof&#8217;s administration, however, according to
      the account of Captain Golofnin, it was an establishment well built and
      furnished with some degree of luxury.

      known as the Baranof Castle, which stood on the hill at the time of the
      transfer to the United States, would seem to be the third building
      constructed on the site, was completed about 1837,<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a

      the ground on the morning of March 17th, 1894.

      The historic building was the scene of many interesting events, and
      sheltered many distinguished persons.

      The first mistress who presided over the mansion on the kekoor was Madame
      Yanovski, a daughter of Baranof and the wife of Lieutenant Yanovski, the
      third chief manager of the Russian American Company.

      Lady Wrangell was the first to come from Russia to preside as the First
      Lady of Sitka, and she was succeeded by Madame Kupreanof, who is said to
      have crossed Siberia and the Pacific Ocean to accompany her husband to his
      post. Sir Edward Belcher gives a spirited account of a ball given in his
      honor, in the castle, which was then, in 1837, just completed. He says:
      &#8220;The evening passed most delightfully,&#8221; although &#8220;few
      could converse with their partners,&#8221; English being spoken by few at
      that time in the capital of Russian America.

      Princess Maksoutoff, the wife of the last chief manager of the colonies,
      came from <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_62"></a>62</span> St.
      Petersburg, but died soon after her arrival, and the stone which marks her
      grave may be seen on the hill between the two cemeteries, near the site of
      the upper Blockhouse. Her successor, the second Princess Maksoutoff, young
      and beautiful, presided with grace and tact over the mansion until the
      transfer of the territory to the United States. She was one of six Russian
      ladies present at the ceremonies and is said to have wept when the Russian
      flag was lowered.

      There is a legend of a beautiful princess whose ghost haunted the Castle
      for many years. The story has been told by many at different times and is
      one of the romantic tales that cluster around the old metropolis of the
      fur trading days. Her lover was sent away or killed through the influence
      of an <i>ober offitzer</i> who sought her hand in marriage. Eliza Ruhamah
      Scidmore, who wrote so delightfully of Sitka in her journeys in Alaska in
      1883, says that, &#8220;By tradition the Lady in Black was the daughter of
      one of the old governors. On her wedding night she disappeared from the
      ballroom in the midst of the festivities, and after a long search was
      found dead in one of the small drawing rooms.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_63"></a>63</span>The chief
      managers entertained lavishly, and the dinners in the Castle were events
      long to be remembered. They were well worthy the representatives of a rich
      and powerful company, a corporation with a domain that was greater than
      the realm of many a royal ruler. Into the sumptuously furnished and richly
      decorated dining-room came the bishop and priests, resplendent in the
      official robes, the naval officers glittering in their gold laced
      uniforms, the secretaries, accountants, storekeepers, all in the uniform
      of the Ministry of Finance, the masters and mates of the ships in the
      harbor; the guests in their best apparel; all gathered around the
      hospitable board of the chief manager. At times a hundred sat at the table
      and back of them dined the cadets of the naval school. After the dinner
      came dancing and until morning the gayety went merrily on, for Russian
      cheer is proverbial, and their hospitality is lavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_64"></a>64</span>Usually the
      Captain of the port, the secretaries, three public and two private, two
      masters in the navy, the commercial agent, two doctors, and the Lutheran
      clergyman, dined with the chief manager by general invitation, Sir George
      Simpson tells us. The civilian masters of vessels, accountants, engineers,
      clerks, and bookkeepers, dined at a club which was organized by Mr.
      Etolin, and they lived at the old club house a little to the east of the
      church.

      A wedding was an elaborate affair, a bridal cake which figured in many
      mystic signs, tea, coffee, chocolate and champagne; the ladies attired in
      muslin dresses, white satin shoes, silk stockings, kid gloves, fans, and
      other necessary appurtances. After the ceremony of an hour and a half was
      consummated, the ball was opened by the bride and the highest officer

      Easter was an event of much hilarity after the close of Lent, which was
      strictly observed by all. From morning to night everyone ran a gauntlet of
      kisses; when two persons met, one said, &#8220;Christ has risen,&#8221;
      while the other replied, &#8220;He has risen, indeed,&#8221; and then
      followed the salutations. These seemed not to have been distasteful to
      visitors, although one remarks that most of <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_65"></a>65</span> the dames had been more liberal with other
      liquids than of pure water. Throughout it all was a continuous peal of
      bells, for the Russian is fond of bell-ringing. All carried eggs, boiled
      into stones, and dyed, gilded or painted, which they presented to their
      friends.

    <p>
      Sitka, under the Muscovite, existed because of the fur trade, and every
      energy and interest centered on the gathering of peltries from every
      available quarter. Sailing ships moved in and out of the harbor, taken to
      their moorings or out to sea by the harbor tug; some from Michaelovsk with
      the beaver and martin from the Yukon, others <i>en route</i> to California
      or to the Sandwich Islands; the supply ships from Kronstadt around Cape
      Horn or returning via Canton and the Cape of Good Hope laden with furs;
      still others bound for the Kuril Islands or Okhotsk. The steamer &#8220;Nikolai&#8221;
      plied along the passages of the Alexander Archipelago, exploring the
      inlets, surveying the bays and rivers, gathering furs, always furs, for
      that was the reason for their living on this distant shore.<a

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_67"></a>67</span>Near the
      entrance to the Kolosh village was the market where the natives were
      permitted to trade. There they brought their game and fish, their furs and
      baskets, to trade for calico and beads, blankets and ammunition.<a
      id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
      This market was closed by a portcullised door which permitted entrance
      through the stockaded wall, and was enclosed by a railed yard. Armed
      guards stood on duty, and at the least dispute in the market, down came
      the door and they proceeded to punish the delinquents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warehouses were stored with thousands on thousands of the richest furs
      of the Northland; sea-otter, worth today from $800 to $1,000 per skin, and
      not to be had at any price, were numbered by thousands in the earlier
      years; sealskins by shiploads, some killed off the harbor, but mainly from
      the Seal Islands; of land otter, the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company paid them
      two thousand skins each year for the lease of the territory from Portland
      Canal to Cape Spencer. The martin, the American sable, with its fluffy
      pelage. Foxes, blue, white, black, silver gray, red and cross, were there
      by thousands, brought from <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_68"></a>68</span>
      the Arctic, from the Aleutian Islands, from the Valley of the Yukon; mink,
      ermine, muskrat, beaver, land otter, pile on pile. Tons of ivory from the
      walrus herds of Morzhovia and bearskins and wolfskins from Cook Inlet and
      the Copper River. The right to the fur trade belonged exclusively to the
      Company by Royal ukase, and any employe who was found attempting to
      infringe on their rights was arrested and sent to Russia for punishment.<a
      id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor"><sup>[17]</sup></a>

    <p>
      From the top of the Castle, over 100 feet above the sea, a light burned as
      a beacon to mariners entering the harbor, and this was the first
      light-house to throw its beams over the waters of this northern ocean. In
      the cupola which rose from the roof were four little square cups into
      which seal oil was poured and wicks burned in grooves rising from them,
      while back of the flame was a reflector that threw the light far out to
      sea among the islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stock of goods in the magazines was large and varied. It covered
      almost every article carried in the general European trade as a necessity,
      and many of the luxuries&#8211;sugar and sealing wax, tobacco, both
      Virginia <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_69"></a>69</span> and
      Kirghis, silk and broadcloth, calico and Flemish linen, ravens duck and
      frieze, arshins of blankets and poods of yarn; vedras of rum, cognac and
      gin; butter from the Yakut, from California and from Kodiak; salt beef
      from Ross Colony, from England and from Kodiak; beaver hats and cotton
      socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the arsenal were kept about a thousand muskets, three hundred pistols,
      two hundred rifles, as well as sabres, cutlasses, etc., while four fire
      engines provided against loss by conflagration. Some rare weapons were
      also found there. A saber set with gems valued at 560 rubles; a Persian
      carbine of a value of 450 rubles; two Persian yatighans, silver mounted; a
      Damascus saber, and two Persian pistols, silver mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers&#8217; guns were for a great part of French or English
      workmanship; rockets and false-fire for signalling ships were made each
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallow for candles was brought from California, moulded at the port and
      distributed so many candles to each employe according to their presumed
      needs each month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquors, generally rum, were served by the Company, a drink twice a week,
      extra allowance being made on difficult work and also for holidays. All
      kinds of devices were resorted to by individuals in order to get rum,
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_70"></a>70</span> and one author
      says that a pair of boots for which the makers would demand ten rubles
      might be secured in barter for a bottle of rum worth three rubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers stationed at the fort when not on duty were employed by the
      Company and given a special compensation for their labor. Some of the
      soldiers and hunters by their industry and thrift accumulated considerable
      money which the Company held to their account and either paid to them on
      their discharge or sent home to Russia for them. Others spent their
      earnings, were continually in debt to the Company, and as their contract
      provided that they were not to be discharged while in arrears of debt,
      some of them served the remainder of their lives with no hope of return to
      Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the hill ran a parapet and sentries walked their beat night and
      day. On the stockade which enclosed the town from the beach at the edge of
      the &#8220;Ranche&#8221; to the shore beyond the sawmill, making with the
      shore line an irregular rectangle, also walked the sentinels on their
      vigil, for the Thlingit at the gates was at all times an enemy to be
      feared. Strict military discipline was maintained at all times. At the
      foot of the hill were clustered barracks, storehouses, bakeries,
      warehouses, etc., for the use of the garrison <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_71"></a>71</span> and workmen. The old structure which was used
      as a bakery, and for shops, was later known as the Sitka Trading Company&#8217;s
      building, and has recently been removed. The barracks are at present the
      jail, and the Russian counting house is today the postoffice of the United
      States. The fur warehouse stood to the west of the hill and was torn down
      in 1897-8, while the landing warehouse on the wharf was burned in 1916.
      These were all built about the time of the incumbency of Etolin, and that
      time might be termed the Golden Age of the Colony. Ships were being built,
      the fur trade was still prosperous, new explorations were being made into
      the interior of the country, trade was being extended into the Yukon
      Valley and there was an active interest in all the industries of the
      settlement. There were men of many trades, engineers, cabinet makers,
      jewelers, tailors, builders, etc., and an efficient machine shop
      constructed engines to equip the vessels constructed in the shipyard.
      Plowshares and spades for the Spanish farmers in California were forged
      and bells for the Franciscan missions were cast here. The first steam
      vessel to be built on the shore of the North Pacific Ocean was constructed
      at Sitka, for, before 1840 the whole of the machinery for a tug of seven
      horsepower, as well as of two pleasure boats <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_72"></a>72</span> had been constructed here. The steamer &#8220;Nikolai&#8221;
      of 70 horsepower was built and equipped with the exception of the boilers
      which were brought from New York. The ship ways at Sitka was the repairing
      place for many a vessel in the days of the gold seekers in the valleys of
      California.

      One day in the spring of 1852 the American ship &#8220;Bacchus&#8221; came
      into Sitka to purchase a cargo of ice. All the ice for San Francisco had
      to this time been brought in the hold of sailing ships around Cape Horn
      from Boston and the idea of getting the supply from Sitka was conceived.
      From the Company&#8217;s icehouses was laden on the ship 250 tons, and
      this was the beginning of a trade during the year of not less than 1800
      tons at an average price of about $25.00 per ton. A Company was organized
      in San Francisco for carrying on the trade and it was known as &#8220;the
      Ice Company.&#8221; The ice on the lake was not of sufficient thickness
      owing to the fact that four degrees below zero is the coldest record ever
      made in Sitka during a hundred years, consequently the Ice Company later
      transferred their chief place of operation to Wood Island, near Kodiak.

      Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_74"></a>74</span> of the Honourable, the Hudson&#8217;s Bay
      Company, visited Sitka in 1841 and in 1842. He describes the settlement,
      the natives, and the fur trade, and was entertained at the Castle by Chief
      Manager Etolin. During his stay he indulged in a Russian steam bath. His
      humorous description of the details ends with a promise never again to
      undergo such a castigation. The account of his stay at the Hot Springs is
      enlivened by a story of how a rosy cheeked Russian damsel, each time she
      passed his chair, made a profound obeisance, which he attributed to his
      personal attraction until he discovered her doing the same when the chair
      was empty, and then saw that a saintly ikon occupied a place on the wall
      directly over it, which dispelled the illusion. Thirteen ships were in the
      harbor, and he remarks that the bustle was sufficient to have done credit
      to a third rate port in the civilized world. Sir George sailed for Okhotsk
      on the Russian ship &#8220;Alexander,&#8221; then crossed Siberia overland
      on his return to England from a journey round the earth.

      There were eighty cannon mounted in the batteries which commanded the bay
      or which looked down on the Kolosh village. These cannon were of different
      make, some being cast in Sitka, others purchased of English or Americans,
      which were purchased on <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_75"></a>75</span>
      the ships on which they were mounted, as on the &#8220;Juno&#8221; and the
      &#8220;Brutus;&#8221; and other ordnance was brought from Kronstadt,
      Russia, as in 1804 on the &#8220;Neva,&#8221; and in 1820 on the &#8220;Borodino.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Teahouses were situated on the little knoll in the center of the town
      where the public Gardens were located; the museum, and the library offered
      instruction to the workers who occupied this lonely post halfway round the
      world from the Russian Fatherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were fourteen chief managers who directed the affairs of the Company
      at Sitka between the date of the founding in 1804 and the surrender to the
      United States in 1867.<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"

      Many of the officers resided long in the colonies and their record would
      establish their right to be denominated as &#8220;Sourdoughs.&#8221;
      Baranof was manager 28 years; Zarembo was rewarded in 1844 for 25 years&#8217;
      service; <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_76"></a>76</span>
      Krukof, the manager at Unalaska, was rewarded in 1821 for 40 years&#8217;
      service; Banner remained at Kodiak for at least ten years, and he and his
      wife both died there; while Kuskof came with Baranof in 1790 and returned
      to Russia in 1821.

      VIII<br /><span class="h2fs">SITKA UNDER UNITED STATES RULE</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then came the day when the Russian was to withdraw from his colonies, and
      the United States was to occupy them as Alaska. An area as broad as an
      empire, equal in extent to Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark combined,
      was to be handed over from the Imperial Ruler of all the Russias to the
      Republic of the United States, and Sitka, the Capital of the Colonies, was
      to be the scene of the actual transfer. The statesmanship of Secretary
      Seward, aided by the eloquence of Sumner, had secured for our country a
      domain one sixth as large as the whole United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 18th, 1867, Alexei Pestchouroff, the Commissioner of the Tsar,
      appeared in front of the Baranof castle, and beside him stood Lovell H.
      Rousseau, the Commissioner for the United States, who was to receive the
      Territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian soldiery were drawn up along the terrace which ran around the
      Baranof <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_78"></a>78</span> Hill,
      and next to them were the men of the United States Infantry.<a
      id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
      The ensign of Russia was lowered, the flag of the United States raised to
      the accompaniment of the salutes from the batteries and of the guns of the
      ships in the harbor.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"
      class="fnanchor"><sup>[23]</sup></a> The few words of the ceremony of
      transfer were spoken, and Alaska became a possession of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the Russian residents went back to their native land as soon as
      they were able to do so, but some remained to cast their lot in the land
      that had so long been their home.<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Among those who
      remained are the Kashavaroffs, the Kostromitinoffs, the Bolshanins, the
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_79"></a>79</span> Shutzoffs, and
      others, whose descendants now live in Alaska.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commanding officer of the American troops, Gen. Jefferson C. Davis,
      made his headquarters in the building on the hill that had been so long
      the residence of the Russian officers. The American soldiers were
      quartered in the barracks of the Siberian Battalion, and the sentries of
      the United States walked the beats of the Russian guards. Sitka gradually
      adjusted itself to the new conditions, to the crowds of adventurers who
      thronged its streets seeking a profit in speculations in lands and furs.
      They were doomed to disappointment, for the titles to lands were withheld
      and the fur trade was overdone, so most of the newly arrived drifted away
      as they came. Distinguished visitors came and were entertained in the old
      castle where the Commandant dispensed hospitality. Lady Franklin, the
      widow of the famous Arctic explorer, was once a guest at the mansion on
      the kekoor, and Secretary Seward was entertained there in 1869 when he
      visited the land he added to the possessions of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the military garrison were content with their conditions and were
      not troubled with the affairs of the world at large, the civil population
      wished for the law and authority of other communities, and set <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_80"></a>80</span> themselves to remedy
      the omission of the Government in far-off Washington so far as was
      possible to do, for there was no provision for an organization of civil
      government in the community. They organized a municipal association,
      drafted ordinances, elected councilmen, collected revenue for improving
      the Governor&#8217;s Walk, changed the name to Lincoln Street, and in
      December opened a school. After five years the civil population declined
      until the revenue was insufficient to maintain the expense, the
      organization was abandoned, with it passed the school, and the first
      attempt at self-government closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed dark days for Sitka.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Military rules
      for the garrison and no law or protection for the people. Soldiers from
      the fort are said to have robbed the church of its ornaments, tearing the
      covers from the richly bound Bible of the Cathedral. The offenders were
      apprehended, but there being no civil law all the punishment meted out was
      to be drummed out of the service and sent to the States on an army
      transport. The stolen property was hidden under the old hospital building
      and was discovered by <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_81"></a>81</span>
      some boys and nearly all was restored to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      On New Year&#8217;s Day, 1869, Colcheka, a noted chief of the Chilkats who
      was visiting Sitka, was entertained by General Davis at the castle on the
      hill. The liquid refreshments served to him by the General raised his
      spirits and his pride of race. After it was over he descended the long
      flight of steps leading from the Commandant&#8217;s quarters and strode
      across the parade ground with the dignity becoming to the hereditary chief
      of the Chilkats, the proudest kwan of the Thlingits. For some reason he
      crossed the part reserved for officers, was challenged by the sentry, and,
      not heeding, when he reached the stockade gate was kicked by the sentry
      stationed there. He was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Me, Colcheka, Chief of the Chilkats, kicked!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned in a rage, seized the musket of the sentry, wrenched it from his
      hands, then carried it to his house in the Ranche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard was turned out for his arrest and a skirmish ensued in which the
      guard was worsted and retreated to the barracks. The Sitkas were neutral.
      The Chilkats were too few in number to fight the troops, so next day
      Colcheka surrendered, was kept in the guardhouse for a few days and then
      released.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_82"></a>82</span>Meantime orders
      that no Indians be permitted to leave the Ranche were issued which were
      revoked upon Colcheka&#8217;s surrender. Through some mistake in revoking
      the orders the sentries were not notified. A canoe load of Indians left
      the Ranche to get wood. The sentries fired on the canoe and killed two of
      the occupants, a Chilkat and a Kake. It was an unfortunate mistake. Those
      shots rang from Lynn Canal to Kuiu Island and the echoes vibrated for more
      than twenty years. By listening intently one might yet hear the
      vibrations. Two white men died and three Indian villages burned directly
      as a result, but it happened in places distant from Sitka, and, as they
      say, it is another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a June day of 1877 the troops of the United States army embarked on a
      ship for the States and sailed away from Sitka. The buildings and property
      were left in charge of the Collector of Customs, who, with the Postmaster,
      constituted the only officials in the Territory. The presence of the
      military had guaranteed safety from attack by the Indians to the people of
      the town, and the officers had been a pleasant addition to the social
      life; with their departure both were lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animosity of the Thlingits had been kindled by many wrongs, some real
      and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_83"></a>83</span> others
      fancied. They saw in the new order of things an opportunity to recompense
      themselves for past grievances. All the old stories of the killing of
      their countrymen by the troops, the burning of old Kake and other
      villages, the loss of five Keeksitties, in the Schooner &#8220;San Diego&#8221;
      in Bering Sea and other tales were rehearsed and were used to stir the
      lust for vengeance. The Keeksittis, under the leadership of Katlean,
      openly advocated sacking the town, killing the men and making slaves of
      the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The government does not care for the country. They have abandoned
      it. It belongs to us, anyway; why not take the town and do as we wish with
      it?&#8221; said Katlean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kokwantons, under Annahootz, their chief, opposed the outrage. For
      months there was danger of an outbreak. Insult after insult was placed
      upon the citizens. The stockade was cut down and carried away by the
      Indians. Every male inhabitant was armed and expecting a call to battle at
      any time. A man was killed at the Hot Springs by a Keeksitty. The murderer
      was arrested through the assistance of the Kokwantons under Annahootz.<a
      id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
      The Keeksitties assembled <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_84"></a>84</span>
      to rescue the criminal, but the citizens of the town rallied for defense,
      the Kokwantons joined them and the murderer was safely placed on board the
      Steamer &#8220;California&#8221; and taken to Portland for trial where he
      was afterward hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same boat went an appeal for assistance, directed to the United
      States Government, but it fell on deaf ears. Another petition was sent to
      Victoria, B. C., and was heeded. Captain A. Holmes A&#8217;Court, of H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;&#8220;Osprey,&#8221;
      at once set out for Sitka, arrived on March 1st, 1879, anchored opposite
      the Ranche and trained his guns for immediate use. The danger was averted.
      Captain A&#8217;Court remained until the arrival of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.
      &#8220;Alaska,&#8221; on April 3rd, then departed for Esquimault with the
      blessings of the grateful people of Sitka.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 14th into the harbor came the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. &#8220;Jamestown.&#8221;
      Her Commander, Captain L. A. Beardslee, assumed control of affairs in the
      community and administered them in a manner which brought credit on his
      name. He found everything at the lowest ebb; every woman and child who
      could leave, had gone to escape the danger of Indian massacre; witchcraft
      prevailed among the natives and anarchy among the whites. He took a <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_85"></a>85</span> census<a
      id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
      upon his arrival, and the result was 325 people, exclusive of the Creole
      population. He appointed an Indian police; established more sanitary
      conditions in the &#8220;Ranche,&#8221; numbered the houses, and compelled
      the attendance of the Indian children at the Mission School.
    </p>
    <p>
      A school was opened in the old Russian barracks building on April 17,
      1878, by Rev. John G. Brady and Miss Fannie E. Kellogg, of the
      Presbyterian Mission, which was later followed by the present Sheldon
      Jackson Mission School. George Kostromitinoff, afterward known as Father
      Sergius, was the interpreter. The opening of the school was a great event
      for Sitka and nearly everyone in the town attended. Annahootz, the
      friendly Kokwantan war chief, made a speech. Mr. Cohen, the brewer, hunted
      up another interpreter to assist. Hymns were sung and the events were
      auspicious. The Indians <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_86"></a>86</span>
      stole in one at a time, some with their faces blackened, all in blankets,
      but they squatted by the wall and listened attentively. The school was
      continued until December, when it was given up, but in the spring of 1880
      Miss Olinda Austin, from New York City, reopened it on April 5th, in one
      of the rooms of the guardhouse, with an attendance of 103 children. The
      school thus established was the beginning of the present Sheldon Jackson
      Training School. The support of the naval officers at the station was such
      that the missionary teacher was moved to say: &#8220;It is not often that
      the Government sends out a missionary, but they have sent one in this
      young commander and his lieutenant, Mr. F. M. Symonds,&#8221; in referring
      to Captain Glass, who succeeded Captain Beardslee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some form of local government giving the residents a right to regulate
      their civil affairs was favored by the Commander, who had not even a code
      under which to act. A meeting was called, ordinances were drafted, a
      magistrate and councilmen elected for a town government. But all were not
      agreed upon these acts and opposition arose against it from the very
      inception of the movement. One of the traders of the town, Caplin, said:
      &#8220;De Captain may go to &#8213; wid his tam <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_87"></a>87</span> government; I&#8217;ll
      bay no daxes.&#8221; And from Silver Bay where he was mining, Geo. E. Pilz
      sent in a protest against the proceeding. The dealers who traded molasses
      to the Indians, from which the villainous liquor called &#8220;hoochinoo&#8221;
      or &#8220;Hooch,&#8221; was distilled, objected to the ordinances
      restricting the trade. Finally an English miner named Roy was shot by his
      partner, &#8220;Scotty,&#8221; and the inability of the self-made
      government to try the offender brought a crisis. The next day a notice
      appeared stating the organization had been dissolved, and the second
      attempt at self-government by the people in Alaska passed into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotty was sent to Oregon for trial and was discharged because of lack of
      a law to punish a man for assault with a dangerous weapon in Alaska.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dawn of a better day was at hand, Alaska&#8217;s darkest hours
      were past, and morning was breaking. The rule of the Navy Department
      continued until 1884, then, although the warships still remained in
      Alaskan waters, by Act of Congress of May 17th, a form of civil government
      was granted, and the official Capital was placed at Sitka. The terror of
      the Indian outbreaks was past; schools were in reach, for the same act
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_88"></a>88</span> provided for
      the establishment of a system of public education, and the Code of Oregon
      was adopted as the law of the land.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some of the life of the former years returned to the beautiful
      village by the sea; there were pleasant parties among the residents, the
      Governor held receptions, the officers of the warships added to the social
      life, many a gay ball was celebrated on the top floor of the court house,
      and for more than twenty years it was the Capital of Alaska.<a
      id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the influx of the Americans prospecting began, for in the vast wild
      mountains of Baranof and Chicagof Islands there is a wealth of mineral
      stored in the ledges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians had attempted to find the mineral of the mountains, and in
      1848 a Mr. Doroshin, a mining engineer, had been sent <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_89"></a>89</span> out from St.
      Petersburg to search for mineral wealth in the colonies. He was not
      successful enough to make it of profit to them, although he found coal on
      Cook Inlet, gold on the Kenai Peninsula, earth promising to bear diamonds
      near Kootznahoo, and copper was known to be on the Myednooskie, or Copper,
      River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discharged soldiers of the garrison were the first to take to the hills
      with pick and shovel. Nicholas Haley, an old-time prospector of Arizona,
      who came with the troops to Sitka, was one of the most energetic and
      daring of these. Year after year, with pick and shovel, with rifle and
      blankets, Nicholas attacked the rugged mountains. Rich specimens were
      brought in and yielded enough when brayed in a mortar to keep him in a
      grubstake, but it takes capital to develop a hard rock mine and capital
      was wary. So Nicholas toiled on year after year, keeping up his
      assessments and living on hopes until at last he passed over the Great
      Divide to a Better Diggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others tried it. In 1878 a mining company was organized at Sitka, but
      there was not yet a law under which a claim could be legally taken. Ledges
      were found, small mills were placed on the ground at the Stewart Mine, the
      Lucky Chance and elsewhere, and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_90"></a>90</span> later great fakes were promoted at the Pande
      Basin and elsewhere. But it was years after that when two Indian boys,
      hunting on Chicagof Island, lay down to drink at a stream, and, behold, in
      the shimmering water was white rock with yellow, glittering particles
      dancing in the clear stream. With the fear it was but fools gold they took
      specimens and marked the place where they were found. When they reached
      Sitka they submitted these samples to Judge DeGroff, and to Professor
      Kelly of the Sheldon Jackson School. It was pronounced to be gold, pure
      shining, yellow gold, and richer than the most sanguine had hoped for.
      After much labor and many disappointments the ledge was located from which
      the float came, and today that mine, the Chicagof it is called, is known
      as the richest and best paying mine in the United States in proportion to
      the money invested, and more than one fortune has been taken out of the
      tunnels in the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off the shores of the continent, reaching far off to the westward almost
      to the shores of Asia are vast fishing grounds, perhaps the greatest in
      the world. A great submarine plateau stretches along shore, past the
      Aleutian Islands and into Bering Sea. There are estimated to be forty
      thousand square miles <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_91"></a>91</span>
      of cod and halibut banks that are known to the surveys. The fisheries of
      Gloucester and Cape Cod fade into insignificance and the famous
      Newfoundland Banks are but small in comparison.

      Sitka goes back the farthest in historic memory of any city of the
      Northwest. When Lewis and Clarke came to the mouth of the Columbia River
      she was looking out over the Pacific from her stockaded walls and Resanof
      was sailing to search for locations for new colonies. When Astoria was
      founded she was placing her outpost on the Russian River in California.
      Before San Francisco was a city she sent her bidarkas to take the
      sea-otter from under the very noses of the Padres in their missions. Here
      the civilization of the East met the progress of the West, the Orient and
      the Occident met here and met without bloodshed. Sitka, with her wealth of
      fisheries in the waters at her doors, with her wealth of mineral in the
      ledges at her back, with the wealth of forest on the mountain slopes
      around her, is in the same latitude as Edinburgh, Scotland. The time is
      coming when she will have population, and wealth; beauty she already has.
      What more is wanted for the happiness of her people? Only energy,
      perseverance, and thrift, and those will be forthcoming.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Approaching Sitka by the usual steamer route from the north at a distance
      of six miles the site of Old Sitka is passed. It lies to the left of the
      steamer track, in a small bay, and is marked by a native house which is
      visible from the ship. From near this place, looking to the westward, the
      first sight of Mount Edgecumbe is to be had between the islands. On
      approaching the town the ship goes through a narrow channel between
      Japonski Island at the right and the townsite at the left. Near the middle
      of the channel a rock is marked by a buoy and along the shore is the
      native village, or &#8220;Ranche,&#8221; with a sloping beach upon which
      in former days the canoes were drawn up. The paths by which they were
      brought from the water may be seen, marked by the rocks being thrown to
      each side from the track.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_93"></a>93</span>On Japonski
      Island is the U.&nbsp;S. Naval Coaling Station and the U.&nbsp;S. wireless
      telegraph. The magnetic observatory of the Russians was situated there.
      The name means Japan Island and is given because Resanof designated it as
      the place to keep captive Japanese whom he expected to capture through his
      expedition against the lower Kuril Islands in 1806.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dock at which the ship lands is in the same location as the one used
      by the Russians, but it has been extended to deeper water. The timbers of
      the old hulk once used by the Russians as a landing stage may still be
      seen in the water at low tide. On the dock was the landing warehouse of
      the Russians, a log structure with a passage through the center. It was
      burned in 1916. Leaving the wharf and going eastward along Lincoln Street,
      at the side are the booths or tents of the native merchants, kept by the
      women from the village, a veritable arcade of little markets, and each of
      the vendors is as interested as though she occupied a seat on the famous
      Rialto Bridge to sell the wares of ancient Venice. The picturesque,
      dark-skinned Thlingit women sit at the doors of their little tents hour
      after hour, offering the strangely carved totems, the beautiful baskets of
      spruce roots woven in mystic designs, the beaded moccasins, etc., products
      of their industry during the long winter when the tourist boats do not
      call at the Sitka <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_94"></a>94</span>
      wharves. Passing up the street to the east from the landing&#8211;at the
      right is the U.&nbsp;S. cable office, occupying the site of the old
      Russian fur warehouse. Next is the three-story building used for
      courthouse and jail, formerly the Russian Barracks where the Siberian
      Battalion was quartered. This is one of the most prominent of the old
      buildings which remain. In front of this is the stairway leading to the
      top of the hill on which is situated the building of the Agricultural
      Department, on the site of the former residence of the chief manager of
      the Russian American Company. Around this hill were the batteries of the
      Russians, commanding the Kolosh village and the harbor. The former
      building was often called the Governor&#8217;s Mansion, or the Baranof
      Castle, was built about 1837 and was destroyed by fire in 1894. The hill
      commands a fine view of the harbor and the surrounding islands. The
      present structure is the headquarters of the Alaska division of the
      Agricultural Department. Opposite the stairway to the hill is the way
      leading to the &#8220;Ranche;&#8221; the open square was the former parade
      ground of the Army, and later of the U.&nbsp;S. Marines from the
      Man-of-War which was stationed here. East of the old barracks building is
      the former counting house of the Company, now occupied as <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_95"></a>95</span> the U.&nbsp;S.
      Postoffice, and during the time when Sitka was the Capital of the
      Territory it was used by the United States for a Customs office, and by
      the Governor as an office. Going east on Lincoln Street, the next large
      building at the right was the old bakery and shops of the Company, later
      commonly known as the Sitka Trading Company Building, having been occupied
      by that company for many years. Beyond this on the same side of the street
      at a short distance is a small building, standing back from the walk,
      surmounted by a Greek cross, which marks the site of the first church
      built in Sitka, in 1817. Next to this lot is the one formerly occupied by
      the Lutheran Church, built in the time of Etolin, and in which the first
      church service was held by Chaplain Rainier of the U.&nbsp;S. Army, after
      the American occupation.

    </div>
    <p>
      Across the street is the Cathedral of St. Michael, the headquarters of the
      Greek Orthodox Church in Alaska. In the Territory are claimed to be ten
      thousand communicants of that faith and from Sitka the management of
      affairs is conducted. The church is in the form of a cross and is
      surmounted by the Greek cross. The interior is richly decorated after the
      usual custom of the Russian churches. Candlesticks of <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_96"></a>96</span> massive design stand
      at either side of the doors of the inner sanctuary. The building, with its
      dome, is distinctive, and is a good example of Russian church
      architecture.<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"
      class="fnanchor"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing east along Lincoln Street a short distance beyond the Cathedral
      a vacant space on the right marks the spot formerly occupied by the
      clubhouse, built by Etolin for a home for the clerks, navigators, and
      other employes of the Company&#8211;opposite it was situated the foundry
      and machine shops, while a little farther to the east stood the sawmills,
      at the mouth of the outlet to Swan Lake. Along this stream was the eastern
      boundary of the stockade of the Russian fort, with a blockhouse near the
      point of the lower end of the lake. East of this stockade were the kitchen
      gardens, but all traces of them have long since vanished. Continuing along
      the street following the shore, the Bishop&#8217;s house is passed on the
      left, where the Russian school is taught, and a short distance beyond is
      the house of the Episcopal Bishop of the diocese, Rev. Bishop P. T. Rowe.
      Still farther to the east is the Sheldon Jackson School, the Presbyterian
      Mission School, consisting of a group of buildings, the first of which was
      completed <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_97"></a>97</span> in
      1880, under the superintendence of Rev. Alonzo Austin, and others have
      been added from time to time until the present fine establishment has
      resulted. An octagonal structure shelters the Sheldon Jackson Museum, a
      fine collection of native work of many kinds, gathered from all parts of
      Alaska by the first superintendent of native schools for the Territory. A
      small paper is published by the mission, the <i>Verstovian</i>, and is
      printed by the native students of the institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the mission, at the edge of the curving beach, a large,
      flat-topped rock lies at the side of the way, called the Blarney Stone. On
      this it is said that Baranof often sat, during the last year of his
      residence here, and looked out through the vistas between the islands to
      the broad Pacific. What were the thoughts of the brave, strong, strange,
      old man as he sat here will never be known, but it is sure that there was
      much of sadness for him in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the Mission is the famous Indian River Road, a continuation of the
      Governor&#8217;s Walk of the Russians, and often called the Lover&#8217;s
      Lane. It winds along the shore of the sea, through the Park, with here and
      there an opening in the forest where there are splendid examples of Hydah
      carvings <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_98"></a>98</span> in
      the tall totems placed in well chosen spots. These totem poles were taken
      to the St. Louis Fair in 1904, as a part of the Alaska Exhibit, and
      afterward returned to this park. One of the most interesting is the house
      totem of Chief Son-i-hat, of Kasaan, accompanied by the four supporting
      columns of the ancient tribal house.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the rustic bridge on the Indian River there are enticing paths
      leading along the stream and toward Mt. Verstovia, which towers above the
      bay to the height of 3,216 feet. Along the river, known as the <i>Kolosh
      Ryeka</i>, by the Russians, the winding paths are bordered with huge Sitka
      spruces and giant cedars, with the space thickly filled with a dense
      growth of shrubbery, among which is prominent the Devil&#8217;s Club (<i>panax
      horridus</i>), with its beautifully palmated leaves and its cruel spines
      concealed underneath. This shrub was formerly used by the natives as an
      instrument of torture in their witchcraft. In the depths of the forest the
      earth is covered with a carpet of ferns and mosses, and the trunks of
      fallen trees of former years may be seen with other trees of from two to
      three feet in diameter growing on their prostrate bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning toward the town, at the Mission the Davis Road turns toward the
      north. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_99"></a>99</span> It was
      built by the Army during their occupation, in the process of their
      securing wood from the forest, and named for General Jeff C. Davis, the
      Commander of the post. Following it the Military Cemetery is reached at
      the distance of about three-eighths of a mile. Here are some interesting
      monuments, among them being that of Gouverneur Morris, a descendent of the
      famous financier of the Revolution. A stone marks the resting place of a
      lieutenant of the U.&nbsp;S. Army, around whose memory lingers stories of
      a duel with a brother officer in a solitary spot along Indian River, over
      a Russian beauty of Sitka.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning aside from Lincoln Street at the Mission, or at the street next
      westward, a walk of a quarter of a mile leads to the experiment farm of
      the Agricultural Department of the United States. There may be seen many
      products, including apples and strawberries of an excellent quality. Of
      the latter is a variety originated by Prof. Georgeson through hybridizing
      the cultivated berries with the wild native berry which grows luxuriantly
      at many places in Alaska.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the Cathedral a street turns northward along which one finds,
      at the right, on the little knoll in the town, among the scattered spruce
      trees, the spot where formerly stood the tea houses of the Russians. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_100"></a>100</span> They were in the
      center of the public gardens which covered the knoll and were approached
      by beautifully bordered walks. Farther along, on the left of the walk, is
      the remaining Russian blockhouse, the last of three which formerly stood
      on the line of the stockade that protected the town from the Kolosh. A
      little back of the blockhouse is the grave of the Princess Maksoutoff,
      marked with a marble slab lying on the raised mound above her resting
      place. At the end of the walk is the modern Russian cemetery, with its
      forest of Greek crosses, and in the center, at the highest point, is a
      platform from which is had an excellent view of the harbor, islands, Mt.
      Edgecumbe, and of the lake and town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning as far as the site of the tea gardens, then going westward
      toward the water, at the right is an enclosure in which there is a small
      building marking the site of the Koloshian Church, or the Church of the
      Resurrection, as it is called in the church records. This was the building
      occupied by the natives in 1855 when they made an attack upon the town. It
      was on the line of the stockade which formerly ran from the water front at
      the end of the &#8220;Ranche,&#8221; east to the lake, then back to the
      water at the sawmill. On the line of the stockade were three blockhouses,
      the church being between the first and second of these. Surrounding the
      site of the church are a number of graves, and among them are some
      interesting monuments dating back to the Russian days, for this is the
      older of the two cemeteries.

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_101"></a>101</span>Going down to
      the entrance to the native town, or &#8220;Ranche,&#8221; there is a
      choice of two streets, one in front of the houses along the water front,
      the other at the rear. The one at the front is preferable. The houses are
      built of lumber and in general are constructed by the native workmen, who
      have been instructed at the mission school, at which there is an excellent
      manual training department. The great tribal houses of former days have
      long since disappeared. The older houses were named by the natives much as
      were the inns of old England; the <i>Gooch-haet</i>, or wolf house; the <i>Tahn-haet</i>,
      or sea-lion house; the <i>Kahse-haet</i>, or cow house, and others, named
      for different animals. The <i>Kahse-haet</i> was named from the head of a
      cow being brought there from a wreck off the coast in which the animal was
      drowned. Formerly there were many canoes along the water front&#8211;as
      many as 150 at a time being often seen, but now their place is occupied by
      gas boats&#8211;generally built by the owners and the engines installed by
      them. The loss in the picturesque is partly compensated by the gain <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_102"></a>102</span> in utility, but
      the native canoe was a wonder of marine architecture, cut from a single
      log and shaped with fire and adzed into elegant lines. An occasional
      specimen is sometimes yet to be seen on the beach or carefully covered
      from the weather in some sheltered and secluded cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no great house totem poles in front of the houses as there are
      at Wrangell, Kasaan and elsewhere. There were some mortuary columns near
      the grave houses which formerly stood on the ridge back of the village,
      but these have long been covered by the dense undergrowth which sprang up
      in recent years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this village have lived some interesting and strong characters.
      Annahootz and Katlean both figured boldly in the history of the town, and
      Sitka Jack was noted for his great potlatch held in 1877, when he gave a
      housewarming at which he presented to his visitors over 500 blankets, not
      to mention the hoochinoo and whiskey which flowed liberally for all. He
      beggared himself by the feast, but his reputation was established above
      reproach for the rest of life. Princess Tom was another celebrity, whose
      fame was founded on her wealth which was estimated at ten thousand
      dollars, and which was acquired by skill in basket making and shrewdness
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_103"></a>103</span> in dealing
      in native manufactures on which she was a connoisseur&#8211;going out to
      the villages in her long canoe to gather the stock of baskets, bracelets,
      carved dishes, masks, dance hats, etc., which she disposed of to advantage
      upon her return to Sitka. Chief Tlan Tech was one of the prominent
      citizens and frequently might have been seen on the street in his frock
      coat, tall hat, with cane and kid gloves, cutting quite a dash. His
      English vocabulary was very limited and he was accustomed for many years
      to fly the Russian flag over his canoe when he went out to a neighboring
      village for a potlatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the silversmiths were skilled workmen. Sitka Jack, and Kooska, and
      Hydah Jake, all fashioned bracelets, spoons, and other articles, carved
      with totemic designs of delicate beauty and line of proportion, made from
      silver coins which they melted down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the shamans of the olden time acquired great influence and made
      life miserable for their fellow-citizens by the practice of witchcraft.
      One of the most obnoxious of these, called Skondoo, was captured and his
      shock of matted hair, which, like that of Samson, was supposed to be the
      seat of his power, was shorn by the commander of the U.S.S. &#8220;Pinta,&#8221;
      and in addition he was <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_104"></a>104</span>
      thoroughly scrubbed with soap and brush, perhaps for the first time in his
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to this day there are instances of the weird belief in the villages
      at Hootznahoo or at Klukwan. Not many years ago an Indian girl was rescued
      by the whites from a damp hole under a house where she had been confined
      to die of cold and starvation by the order of the shaman, or <i>Ekht</i>,
      as the Thlingit calls him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the island and the inlet dented shores surrounding the town are many
      interesting places forming an opportunity for delightful excursions. The
      most desirable of these are:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount Edgecumbe, 3467 ft.&#8211;Taking a launch from Sitka the trip may be
      made to Crab Bay, or to the landing behind the island of St. Lazaria on
      which is a populous bird rookery, and the ascent of the mountain is
      possible to be made in a day. Perhaps better that two days be taken to the
      trip, however. The first to go to the top was Lisianski in 1804. From the
      summit of the mountain an unusually beautiful panorama is to be had of
      island-studded bay, and mountain ridges capped with glaciers on one side,
      while on the other spreads the expanse of the broad Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sitka, and Katleanski Bay.&#8211;By <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_105"></a>105</span> launch the site of the Russian settlement of
      1799-1802 may be reached and from that point a continuation of the
      excursion may be made to the head of Nesquashanski Bay, where the meadows
      are situated from which the Russians procured their provender for the
      cattle kept at the post. In the streams entering the bay may be seen,
      during the season of the salmon run, the strange spectacle of the brown
      bears in the role of fishermen, scooping salmon from the waters with their
      paws, if good fortune attend. This journey may be made in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver Bay.&#8211;A veritable Norwegian fjord transplanted to Alaska&#8211;with
      picturesque waterfalls plunging into its waters, deep glacial valleys
      entering at right angles with Yosemite-like cliffs bordering them, the
      Scottish bluebells clinging to the dripping rocks which beetle overhead,
      Kalampy&#8217;s Slide around which hangs a tale, the Stewart mine, etc.&#8211;about
      ten miles to the head of the bay, where a fine waterfall plunges from the
      mountainside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Redoubt and the Globokoe Lake.&#8211;Southwest from Sitka about ten
      miles was the location of the fishery of the Russians from which for more
      than sixty years they drew their stores of <i>krasnia ruiba</i> (the red
      salmon), which provided so important a part <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_106"></a>106</span> of their subsistence. Here in the rocky wall
      which divided Globokoe, or Deep Lake, from the sea, and over which the
      outlet flowed, channels were blasted, forming reservoirs, and in these
      channels were placed <i>zapors</i>, or fences, which made traps into which
      the salmon swam and lay in the clear cold pools until they were removed
      for use. Here also was one of the Russian flouring mills, where they
      ground the wheat brought from California, or from the farms of the Hudson&#8217;s
      Bay Company at Nisqually or on the Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sitka Hot Springs.&#8211;About four miles farther to the southwest
      than the Redoubt, is situated the Sitka Hot Springs, possessing valuable
      medicinal qualities, and used for more than a century as a health resort.
      Here Dr. Goddard has established a sanitarium in the midst of a veritable
      nature lover&#8217;s paradise, the forest behind, and the island-studded
      sea in front, with game in the deep woods and fish in the sea, all to be
      had for the taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other interesting and beautiful places may be visited. Lisianski Bay,
      Deep Bay, Herring Bay with the gorge of Sawmill Creek and the chain of
      lakes, Blue Lake, and others lying adjacent, are among the important ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_107"></a>107</span>Mt.
      Verstovia.&#8211;The ascent of this mountain comprises one of the most
      interesting excursions about the town. The trail leaves the shore of
      Jamestown Bay at the point where the trough of the watering place of the
      &#8220;Jamestown,&#8221; came to the beach. This place may be reached by
      boat or on foot through the Park by the mouth of Indian River. The ascent
      should be under the guidance of one familiar with the route, for it is not
      plainly marked and none but an experienced woodsman can find the way
      alone. It leads through a forest, the first 800 or 1,000 feet through
      dense undergrowth under the trees, the mosses and ferns forming a
      veritable carpet; above that the woods are more open&#8211;at about 2,500
      feet the forest ceases. It is called Koster's Trail. The first eminence or
      shoulder of the mountain is near the timber line and is often spoken of as
      the Mountain of the Cross, while above it towers the Arrowhead, or the
      summit of Verstovia, otherwise called at times Popoff Mountain, or the
      Ponce, to a height of 3,216 feet, nearly a Russian verst, and from this it
      derives its name. From the top an expanse of island-studded waters stretch
      toward the sea. Eastward crest after crest of glacier-capped peaks rise
      for a hundred miles, northward the lofty summits of Mt. Crillon and Mt.
      Fairweather may be seen at an elevation of <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_108"></a>108</span> over 15,000 feet, equal in height to the
      highest Alp of Switzerland. Around the base of the Arrowhead, in July and
      August, are found a myriad of wild flowers, carpeting the earth&#8211;violets,
      daises, cyclamen, and a multitude of others.

        January 20th, 1820, a letter written by the Directory at St. Petersburg
        to Chief Manager Muravief at Sitka enclosing instructions previously
        given to Hagemeister, instructing him to find the descendants of
        Chirikof&#8217;s lost men, urging that it must be done, and expressing
        surprise that it had been neglected thus long. (Russian American

        In Wrangell, and at a few other places in Alaska may yet be seen some of
        these old tribal houses, built as in primitive days in most ways. The
        beams and planks were fashioned with an adze, and the evenness of the
        workmanship in hewing them is marvelous.

        These books and letters were brought by Resanof in the &#8220;Nedeshda,&#8221;
        and upon reaching Kodiak Resanof established the library at that place.
        It was afterward removed to Sitka, probably by Baranof when he changed
        the chief factory to that place in 1807. After the United States took
        possession the library disappeared, whether taken to Russia or left in
        Sitka does not appear, but the books were likely left in Sitka and
        gradually disappeared through theft in the years when there was no

        Frederick Schwatka, the explorer, seems to have been one of the first to
        put the story in print, which he did in the early eighties. It appeared
        in the Alaska News, a newspaper of Juneau, on December 24th, 1896, and
        the time is fixed as being in the administration of Baron Wrangell. In
        1891 Hon. Henry E. Hayden published it in verse in a small volume
        printed at Sitka. John W. Arctander, in his Lady in Blue, elaborates it
        to a small volume and ascribes it to Etolin&#8217;s time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a strange fact which gives some color to the story. In the
        Russian American Company&#8217;s Archives now on file in the State
        Department, Washington, D. C., under date of September 23rd, 1833, a
        letter from St. Petersburg refers to a report of Baron Wrangell of
        November 30, 1831, which reported the death of under officer Paul
        Buikof, and implicating one Col. Borusof. Unfortunately the records of
        1831 are missing and so the report cannot be had. Baron Wrangell&#8217;s
        daughter, Mary, died during his stay in Sitka.
